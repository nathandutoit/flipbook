Introducing international family law\u000d\u000aInternational family law is a loose term that describes any and all family law matters that have an \u000d\u000ainternational element. That element may be that a spouse, a spouse-to-be, or a child is a national or \u000d\u000adomiciliary of another country. Or it may be that the spouses are in a country other than their country of \u000d\u000aorigin, or that a child is away from its country of origin, or that spousal assets are in another country. It may \u000d\u000aeven include a family that lives in the country of origin of all members of the family, one of whom might \u000d\u000ain the future be located overseas or have assets overseas. As such it could encompass almost all families \u000d\u000asince it is now the norm for families to have at least one member who is out of the country at some point of \u000d\u000atime.\u000d\u000aInternational family law is a fast-growing area. More and more people are residing internationally and \u000d\u000aexperiencing international relationships. Americans travel and spend time overseas much more than before \u000d\u000aand immigration into the United States continues unabated. There is also an explosion in remote \u000d\u000arelationships as the Internet allows people to link up with anyone in the world. Consequently, many more \u000d\u000arelationships in this country now have an international component.\u000d\u000aInternational relationships are particularly prone to breakdown because of the additional pressures that \u000d\u000aresult from differences in culture, language, and religion and the issues that may arise from such factors as \u000d\u000aextended family involvement, particular economic pressures that international relationships often create, \u000d\u000aimmigration or emigration difficulties, and job transfer problems.\u000d\u000aParadoxically, while we live in an era of globalization and instantaneous international connections, family \u000d\u000alaws remain almost completely local and parochial. Family law is handled in the United States at the state \u000d\u000alevel. Although the differences between the states as to family law have been reduced in recent years, as a \u000d\u000aresult of federal legislation in some areas (e.g., child support), the promulgation of uniform laws in other \u000d\u000aareas (e.g., child custody), and a general trend towards uniformity in all matters across the country, changes \u000d\u000ain family law are made by state legislatures. Elsewhere, family law continues to be the domain of nation \u000d\u000astates and to be interwoven with local culture, religion, and history. Within some regions, of which \u000d\u000acontinental Europe is the prime example, there is a trend towards some regional standardization of family \u000d\u000alaws but in general nation states continue to guard their sovereign right to promulgate family laws that \u000d\u000apurport to be right for their local society.\u000d\u000aMoreover, family law changes at a far slower pace than society in general. While the numbers of nonmarital heterosexual partnerships and of same-sex relationships are growing enormously, at least in the \u000d\u000aWestern world, most countries have still not reformed their family laws to accommodate these trends. While \u000d\u000athe model of a family unit that is permanently located in a particular jurisdiction is in fact becoming \u000d\u000aincreasingly outmoded, divorce laws generally remain wedded to the idea that marriages should be \u000d\u000agoverned by the law of the one certain place to which they \u201cbelong.\u201d","Chapter 1: International Family Law Page 2\u000d\u000a\u00a7 1:3. What international family law is and is not\u000d\u000aThere is really no such thing as \u201cInternational Family Law.\u201d Clients and even some lawyers who do not \u000d\u000aknow this area of the law often ask, \u201cWhat is the international law?\u201d on such issues as, \u201cWhich court has \u000d\u000ajurisdiction of my divorce case?\u201d or \u201cWill my marriage be recognized?\u201d The answer invariably is that \u000d\u000a\u201cinternational law\u201d does not apply and that the question cannot be answered without first knowing which \u000d\u000acountry (and often which state or province within a country) will be the forum in which the issue will be \u000d\u000araised, then determining and applying the law of that particular jurisdiction as to which country's or state's \u000d\u000alaw will apply, and then by applying that local law. Matters are further complicated when there is a choice \u000d\u000aamong possible forums and when under the laws of some jurisdictions, particularly the United States, there \u000d\u000aare different standards for determining whether a court has jurisdictions over particular components of a \u000d\u000acase. Thus, in the United States different jurisdictional rules apply to the issues of (a) whether a state can \u000d\u000aissue a judgment of divorce, (b) whether a state can handle the financial consequences of a divorce, and (c) \u000d\u000awhether a state has child custody jurisdiction.\u000d\u000aInternational family law is really nothing more than domestic family law as it applies to the international \u000d\u000aaspects of a case. There are some international treaties that apply to some of these cases, the most prominent\u000d\u000aof which is the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, but they apply \u000d\u000aonly because they have been incorporated into domestic law and only to the extent of that incorporation. \u000d\u000aAlthough the United States Congress has power to enter into binding international treaties, in the area of \u000d\u000afamily law it has done so rarely. In any event, such treaties are generally brought into domestic law by \u000d\u000aspecific legislation. There is no international court that applies or enforces treaty obligations in the area of \u000d\u000aU.S. family law. Within regional country groupings, international regulation of family law matters may be \u000d\u000asomewhat supranational in nature, as is the case with the European Union, but the United States is not a \u000d\u000amember of any such organization.\u000d\u000aEven when international treaties concerning family matters have been brought into domestic law, their \u000d\u000ainterpretation and enforcement is handled at the local level. Consequently, there may be substantial variance \u000d\u000ain the meaning and effect of those treaties as they are applied by local courts and enforced by local \u000d\u000aauthorities. Thus, the terms \u201cright of custody\u201d and \u201chabitual residence\u201d in Article 3 of the Hague Abduction \u000d\u000aConvention are interpreted in very different ways in different U.S. circuits and in foreign countries \u000d\u000adespite the fact that the courts in the U.S. and the U.K., for example, have asserted that there should be \u201can \u000d\u000aautonomous meaning, a meaning independent of that which they would be given in the domestic laws of \u000d\u000aany of the states parties.\u201d\u000d\u000aIn many ways international family law is international comparative law. An international family lawyer \u000d\u000amust be open to understanding, and sometimes even mastering, the family laws of other countries. Clients \u000d\u000awith ties to different jurisdictions need to understand the potential impact of the family laws of different \u000d\u000acountries on the situation they are in currently or in which they may find themselves in the future. While \u000d\u000aan international family lawyer in the United States is unlikely to be admitted to practice in other countries \u000d\u000ahe or she will usually have a good understanding of the family laws of some other countries and will be \u000d\u000aopen to learning about the family laws of all other jurisdictions.\u000d\u000a\u00a7 1:4. Collaboration function of international family lawyer\u000d\u000aAn international family lawyer is usually a collaborator who works well with local family lawyers in other \u000d\u000ajurisdictions, whether of a similar legal heritage or an entirely \u201cforeign\u201d one. While an American lawyer \u000d\u000awill be reasonably comfortable collaborating on a U.S.\u2013Australian case with an Australian lawyer who not ","Chapter 1: International Family Law Page 3\u000d\u000aonly speaks English but also is trained in and works in a common law based on English notions of stare \u000d\u000adecisis, it will be far more challenging in a U.S.\u2013French, a U.S.\u2013Chilean, or a U.S.\u2013Japanese case for an \u000d\u000aAmerican lawyer to work with a French, Chilean, or Japanese counterpart. The language challenges are \u000d\u000alikely to be far more surmountable than the challenges of understanding enough of the foreign law to be \u000d\u000aable to make a useful contribution to decisions of importance to a client.\u000d\u000aIt is generally important that the international family lawyer should have, or develop, an international \u000d\u000anetwork of lawyers around the world with whom to collaborate.\u000d\u000a\u00a7 1:5. Areas in which an international family lawyer works\u000d\u000aThe specific areas in which a well-rounded international family lawyer in the U.S. is most likely to work \u000d\u000ainclude the following:\u000d\u000a\u25cf The prevention of international child abduction, including:\u000d\u000ao Securing restraining orders;\u000d\u000ao Drafting those provisions in custody orders concerning international travel.\u000d\u000a\u25cf The recovery of children who have been abducted to foreign countries, including:\u000d\u000ao Securing appropriate custody orders from local courts in the U.S.;\u000d\u000ao Drafting Hague Convention applications;\u000d\u000ao Securing criminal arrest warrants;\u000d\u000ao Securing Interpol support;\u000d\u000ao Retaining and liaising with counsel in the foreign country.\u000d\u000a\u25cf International child custody matters, including:\u000d\u000ao International child custody jurisdiction;\u000d\u000ao Enforcement of foreign-country custody orders;\u000d\u000ao Modification of foreign-country custody orders;\u000d\u000ao Foreign-country enforcement of U.S. custody orders;\u000d\u000ao Applications for relocation of children to foreign countries.\u000d\u000a\u25cf International divorce issues, including:\u000d\u000ao Divorce jurisdiction planning for international people;\u000d\u000ao Divorce jurisdiction litigation when there is a foreign-country element;\u000d\u000ao Securing stays of domestic divorce actions because of the pendency of foreign-country \u000d\u000acases;\u000d\u000ao Securing recognition in U.S. of foreign-country divorce decrees;\u000d\u000ao Enforcement of foreign-country divorce decrees in the U.S.\u000d\u000a\u25cf International prenuptial agreement planning and drafting.\u000d\u000a\u25cf International postnuptial agreement planning and drafting.\u000d\u000a\u25cf International child support issues, including:\u000d\u000ao Foreign-country enforcement of U.S. divorce decrees;\u000d\u000ao Enforcement of foreign-country support orders;\u000d\u000ao Modification of foreign-country support orders;\u000d\u000ao Foreign-country enforcement of U.S. support orders.","Chapter 1: International Family Law Page 4\u000d\u000aSECTION 1.2 WHY STUDY INTERNATIONAL FAMILY LAW?\u000d\u000aInternational Family Law: An Introduction\u000d\u000aBarbara Stark\u000d\u000aWhy Study \u2018International\u2019 Family Law?\u000d\u000aThis question contains three related but distinct questions, all of which pivot on the multiple \u000d\u000ameanings of \u2018international\u2019 in this context. First, why study international family law as opposed to domestic \u000d\u000afamily law? Second, why study international family law as opposed to comparative family law? Third, why \u000d\u000astudy international (i.e. private and public) family law rather than private family law?\u000d\u000a\u2018International\u2019 vs. \u2018Domestic\u2019 Family Law: The Importance of International Family Law \u000d\u000aThe answer here is pragmatic. International Family Law (IFL) is an essential part of any Family \u000d\u000aLaw curriculum, or any family lawyer\u2019s library, because the practice of family law has in fact become \u000d\u000aglobalized. Lawyers inevitably encounter clients whose family law problems extend beyond national \u000d\u000aboundaries, including problems in which the laws of more than one state must be taken into account. \u000d\u000aLawyers everywhere are increasingly confronted with issues regarding international adoption, child \u000d\u000aabduction, divorce, custody and domestic violence, where the parties reside in, or are citizens of, different \u000d\u000astates. \u000d\u000aThis is not surprising. As the United Nations notes, families are the primary unit of social \u000d\u000aorganization, and families are changing, trying to adapt to new demands and taking advantage of new \u000d\u000amobility. Globalization is transforming family law. Women are seeking asylum as refugees, fleeing \u000d\u000adomestic violence. Workers are following jobs, leaving their families behind and sometimes starting new \u000d\u000afamilies in their new countries. Child abduction has become an increasing threat as parents of different \u000d\u000anationalities divorce, and both want their children to be raised in their own national traditions. \u000d\u000aEven as ties to such traditions become increasingly attenuated, their appeal may become stronger \u000d\u000afor some. Local religious leaders, similarly, may insist on even stricter adherence to local customs, \u000d\u000aespecially those related to marriage, divorce, and the care and custody of children, as their authority is \u000d\u000achallenged by competing customs and international norms. In many States, such as Saudi Arabia, family \u000d\u000alaw is basically left to religious authorities. This reflects both its relatively low importance to national \u000d\u000agovernments (compared to matters of trade and finance, for example) and its paradoxically high importance \u000d\u000ato those who seek to shape the national identity. As Article 9 of the Basic Law of Saudi Arabia states, \u2018the \u000d\u000afamily is the kernel of Saudi society, and its members shall be brought up on the basis of Islamic faith.\u2019 \u000d\u000aThere are powerful trends and countertrends everywhere, and competing norms of family law are at the \u000d\u000acore of each. \u000d\u000aThese play out in a range of contexts, such as the recognition of marriage, child custody jurisdiction, \u000d\u000aenforcement of foreign support awards, and adoptions, which already claim a significant amount of class \u000d\u000atime in family law courses and account for a similarly significant number of hours in family law practice. \u000d\u000aThe extraterritorial expansion of family law poses new challenges, but the basic analytic framework remains \u000d\u000athe same. First, we identify procedures that do not mesh, distinguishing those that are better characterized \u000d\u000aas procedural from those that reflect more substantive differences in underlying policy. Second, we find or \u000d\u000acreate mechanisms for reconciliation, where possible, or for the orderly resolution of disputes where \u000d\u000areconciliation is not possible. \u000d\u000aWhile major issues in international family law, such as those addressed in the Hague Convention \u000d\u000aon Child Abduction, can be at least touched upon in a general course, growing numbers of students go on \u000d\u000ato specialize in family law. For these future lawyers, IFL is increasingly a necessity. In fact, the failure to \u000d\u000aanticipate international family law issues, such as the removal of children to another country during \u000d\u000avisitation, may well expose a lawyer to a malpractice claim. ","Chapter 1: International Family Law Page 5\u000d\u000a\u2018International\u2019 Family Law vs. \u2018Comparative\u2019 Family Law \u000d\u000aSecond, why study \u2018international family\u2019 as opposed to \u2018comparative\u2019 family law? \u2018International\u2019 here \u000d\u000arefers to shared or agreed upon rules and norms among a group of States, while \u2018comparative\u2019 refers to the \u000d\u000arespective rules and norms applicable in two or more particular States. Comparative family law is an \u000d\u000aessential component of IFL. The ways in which different domestic legal systems address custody disputes \u000d\u000aor invalidate marriages must be understood in the practice of IFL. The study of comparative law is also \u000d\u000ainvaluable for gaining insight into other cultures and expanding horizons. Lawmakers increasingly look \u000d\u000aabroad for new approaches to intractable domestic problems. \u000d\u000aThey must keep in mind, however, that legal norms do not operate in the abstract, but in specific \u000d\u000acultural contexts. A particular reform, such as retroactive laws opening adoption records, might be \u000d\u000afunctional because it is compatible with the underlying social norms in one context but not in another. \u000d\u000aComparative family law requires lawyers to focus on the ways in which culture supports or undermines \u000d\u000alaw. The comparative perspective not only provides a window into another culture, but exposes the often \u000d\u000aunquestioned assumptions of one\u2019s own. Studying custodial presumptions in Islamic states, for example, \u000d\u000aexposes ways in which culture shapes such presumptions, which may not be as visible when dealing with \u000d\u000athe culture in which we are immersed. \u000d\u000aThus, the comparative element of international family law enables law students to gain a \u000d\u000aperspective on their own law. While comparative analysis is an integral part of IFL, the analytic and \u000d\u000aprocedural processes which govern the interaction between national laws is the focus of this book. That is, \u000d\u000athe emphasis here is on the legal mechanisms devised by the international community to resolve or reconcile \u000d\u000athe different perspectives that a study of comparative family law reveals. \u000d\u000a\u2018International\u2019 Family Law vs. \u2018Private\u2019 International Family Law \u000d\u000a\u2018Private\u2019 international law historically referred to the rules regarding conflicts of law in disputes \u000d\u000abetween private legal persons, including individuals or corporations. Public international law, in contrast, \u000d\u000ahistorically referred to the rules and norms governing disputes among nation States. As many commentators \u000d\u000ahave observed, the distinction between public and private international law has steadily eroded. States \u000d\u000aincreasingly engage in the same kinds of commercial activities as private entities. In addition, because of \u000d\u000athe growing influence of international human rights, the individual has increasingly become the subject of \u000d\u000apublic international law. \u000d\u000aHistorically, IFL has been regarded primarily as the province of private international law, requiring \u000d\u000afamiliarity with conflicts of law principles in general and the conventions promulgated by the Hague \u000d\u000aConference on Private Law in particular. Public international law plays an increasingly important role, \u000d\u000ahowever. Even as the Hague Conference studies the problem of transnational child support, for example, \u000d\u000aStates enter into growing numbers of bilateral treaties addressing the issue. Such treaties are governed by \u000d\u000apublic international law. International human rights law, moreover, has become an increasingly pervasive \u000d\u000afactor in international family law, from the refusal to recognize institutions such as polygamy (as a violation \u000d\u000aof human rights) to the recognition of reproductive rights. \u000d\u000aInternational human rights law also recognizes affirmative economic, social, and cultural rights, \u000d\u000asuch as the right to maternal protection before and after the birth of a child, which are explicitly identified \u000d\u000aas rights owed to the family as such. Finally, rights of individuals within the family, such as the child\u2019s \u000d\u000arights to freedom of religion, raise issues of State interference with family privacy. The State has an \u000d\u000aobligation to protect the child\u2019s rights without violating the rights of the family unit. \u000d\u000aIn sum, the erosion between public and private international law has been so thorough in the context \u000d\u000aof international family law that the subject can no longer be understood merely as a part of private \u000d\u000ainternational law. Rather, it requires a grasp of the applicable public international laws, especially human \u000d\u000arights law, as well. \u000d\u000aHague Conference","Chapter 1: International Family Law Page 6\u000d\u000aIntro The Hague Conference on private international law is an intergovernmental organization the \u000d\u000apurpose of which is \u2018to work for the progressive unification of the rules of private international law\u2019 \u000d\u000a(Statute, Article 1). \u000d\u000aBackground, Establishment and Status The First Session of the Hague Conference on private \u000d\u000ainternational law was convened in 1893 by the Netherlands Government on the initiative of T.M.C. Asser. \u000d\u000aThe Seventh Session in 1951 marked the beginning of a new era with the Plenary Sessions meet in principle \u000d\u000aevery four years in ordinary diplomatic session. In case of need, as occurred in 1966 and 1985, an \u000d\u000aExtraordinary Session may be held. The Plenary Sessions discuss and adopt the draft Conventions (and \u000d\u000asometimes Recommendations) prepared by the Special Commissions and take decisions on the subjects to \u000d\u000abe included in the agenda for the Conference\u2019s work. All of the texts adopted are brought together in a Final \u000d\u000aAct which is signed by the delegations. Under the rules of procedure of the Plenary Sessions each Member \u000d\u000aState has one vote. Decisions are taken by a majority of the votes cast by the delegations of Member States \u000d\u000awhich are present at the vote. Non-Member States invited to participate on an equal footing with Member \u000d\u000aStates also have the right to vote. \u000d\u000aSecretariat The activities of the Conference are organized by a secretariat \u2013 the Permanent Bureau \u000d\u000a\u2013 which has its seat at The Hague and whose officials must be of different nationalities. The Secretary \u000d\u000aGeneral is currently assisted by four lawyers: a Deputy Secretary General and three First Secretaries. The \u000d\u000aPermanent Bureau\u2019s main task is the preparation and organization of the Plenary Sessions and the Special \u000d\u000aCommissions. Its members carry out the basic research required for any subject that the Conference takes \u000d\u000aup. \u000d\u000aMethods of operation The principal method used to achieve the purpose of the Conference consists \u000d\u000ain the negotiation and drafting of multilateral treaties or Conventions in the different fields of private \u000d\u000ainternational law (international judicial and administrative cooperation; maintenance obligations, status and \u000d\u000aprotection of children, relations between spouses. After preparatory research has been done by the \u000d\u000asecretariat, preliminary drafts of the Conventions are drawn up by the Special Commissions made up of \u000d\u000agovernmental experts. The drafts are then discussed and adopted at a Plenary Session of the Hague \u000d\u000aConference, which is a diplomatic conference. \u000d\u000aThe secretariat of the Hague Conference maintains close contacts with the Governments of its \u000d\u000aMember States through National Organs designated by each Government. For the purpose of monitoring \u000d\u000athe operation of certain treaties involving judicial or administrative co-operation, the Permanent Bureau \u000d\u000aenters into direct contact from time to time with the Central Authorities designated by the States Parties to \u000d\u000asuch treaties. In order to promote international co-operation and to ensure co-ordination of work undertaken \u000d\u000aby different bodies, the Hague Conference also maintains continuing contacts with a number of \u000d\u000ainternational organizations, including the United Nations \u2013 particularly its Commission of International \u000d\u000aTrade Law (UNCITRAL), UNICEF, the Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the High \u000d\u000aCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) \u2013 the Council of Europe, the European Union, the Organization of \u000d\u000aAmerican States, the Commonwealth Secretariat, the Asian-African Legal Consultative Committee, the \u000d\u000aInternational Institute for the Unification of Private Law (Unidroit) and others. Certain non-governmental \u000d\u000aorganizations, such as the International Chamber of Commerce, the International Bar Association, \u000d\u000aInternational Social Service, the International Society of Family Law and the International Union of Latin \u000d\u000aNotaries also send observers to follow the meetings of the Hague Conference. \u000d\u000aAchievements, monitoring of results and work in progress From 1951 to 2002 the Conference \u000d\u000aadopted 35 international Conventions. Until 1960 the Conventions were drafted only in French; since then \u000d\u000athey have been drawn up in French and English. Among those that have been the most widely ratified, the \u000d\u000afollowing Conventions should be mentioned: maintenance obligations, recognition of divorces, protection \u000d\u000aof minors, international child abduction and intercountry adoption. Some of the Hague Conventions deal \u000d\u000awith the determination of the applicable law, some with the conflict of jurisdictions, some with the ","Chapter 1: International Family Law Page 7\u000d\u000arecognition and enforcement of foreign judgments and some with administrative and judicial co-operation \u000d\u000abetween authorities. Some of the Hague Conventions combine one or more of these aspects of private \u000d\u000ainternational law. From time to time, Special Commissions are held at The Hague to monitor the practical \u000d\u000aoperation of Hague Conventions. In the past, such Commissions have been convoked for the Child \u000d\u000aAbduction Convention, the Intercountry Adoption Convention and the Conventions on maintenance \u000d\u000a(support) obligations. \u000d\u000aPrivate International Law Conventions \u000d\u000aFamily law in many States is a matter of national or sub-national, i.e., state or provincial, law. A \u000d\u000amajor exception is those States in which family law is basically delegated to religious authorities. IFL \u000d\u000afocuses on the ways in which these various systems are harmonized on the international level. \u000d\u000aThis has been accomplished through private international law conventions, such as the Hague \u000d\u000aConvention on Child Abduction, the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption, and the Convention on \u000d\u000athe Law Applicable to Maintenance Obligations Toward Children. A list of the Hague Conventions on \u000d\u000aPrivate International Law can be found at www.hcch.net/e/conventions/index.html. (Lists of States Parties \u000d\u000aare also available at this site.) These treaties are binding on States parties. In many States, such treaties \u000d\u000abecome enforceable in national courts through implementing legislation. Under international law, a State \u000d\u000ais legally obligated under a convention it has ratified even if it has not yet enacted domestic law to \u000d\u000aimplement that treaty. \u000d\u000aAn excellent introduction to the Hague Conference is available on its website. An excerpt is printed \u000d\u000abelow. \u000d\u000aPublic International Law \u000d\u000aState family law is also subject to public international law, including international human rights \u000d\u000alaw. As set out in the Statute of the International Court of Justice, there are three sources of international \u000d\u000alaw. First, international law may be made by treaty; that is, a binding agreement entered into by two or \u000d\u000amore States. Examples include the U.N. Charter and the human rights conventions discussed below, all of \u000d\u000awhich are multilateral treaties, and the bilateral treaties regarding child support and spousal maintenance. \u000d\u000aSecond, international law may be found in customary international law, which has two elements: \u000d\u000a(1) State practice, and (2) opinio juris; that is, the belief that such State practice is legally mandated. Torture, \u000d\u000afor example, is a violation of customary international law. No State claims that it may legally engage in \u000d\u000atorture. On the contrary, all States have official policies against torture, reflecting their common \u000d\u000aunderstanding that it is prohibited in the international community. This does not mean, of course, that no \u000d\u000aState actually engages in torture. It simply means that it does so secretly, or contends that a particular \u000d\u000apractice is not in fact \u2018torture.\u2019 As discussed in Chapter 11, for example, domestic violence may amount to \u000d\u000atorture although this is not recognized by most States. \u000d\u000aCustomary international law may be shown through State practice over time, in the form of State \u000d\u000aadherence to international treaties, declarations, or General Assembly resolutions, through the enactment \u000d\u000aof domestic legislation, through executive action, and through a State\u2019s own judicial decisions. The \u000d\u000aaccretion of such practice, accompanied by evidence that the State believed that such practice was legally \u000d\u000amandated, constitutes customary international law. Where consensus among States is clear and no State \u000d\u000aobjects, less practice may be needed. \u000d\u000aThird, and finally, international law may be found in the \u2018general principles\u2019 of law recognized by \u000d\u000aStates. These include principles such as res judicata or the commonly accepted understanding that \u000d\u000astatements made to one\u2019s lawyer are privileged. In the context of ILF, however, general principles may not \u000d\u000abe applicable. Res judicata, for example, may not apply to the custody determination of one State because \u000d\u000aanother considers that determination subject to its modification, or contrary to the best interest of the child. \u000d\u000aThe major international human rights treaties affecting family law are the International Covenant \u000d\u000aon Civil and Political Rights (\u2018ICCPR\u2019 or the \u2018Civil Covenant,\u2019) the International Covenant on Economic,","Chapter 1: International Family Law Page 8\u000d\u000aSocial, and Cultural Rights (\u2018ICESCR\u2019 or the \u2018Economic Covenant\u2019), the Convention on the Elimination \u000d\u000aof All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (\u2018CEDAW\u2019 or the \u2018Women\u2019s Convention\u2019), and the \u000d\u000aConvention on the Rights of the Child (\u2018CRC\u2019 or the \u2018Child\u2019s Convention\u2019). \u000d\u000aComplete texts of the instruments can be found in the treaty series cited in the chapters or at \u000d\u000ahttp://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree. (Lists of States Parties are also available at this site.) \u000d\u000aSome States ratify human rights conventions subject to reservations regarding specific provisions. \u000d\u000aThis means that the State accepts its obligations under the treaty with the exception of the particular article \u000d\u000ato which it has taken a reservation. Many Islamic States, for example, have taken reservations to Article 16 \u000d\u000aof the Women\u2019s Convention, addressing family rights. The usual reservation provides that the State accepts \u000d\u000athe cited article to the extent that it is consistent with Shari\u2019ah, Islamic personal law. \u000d\u000aRegional Conventions \u000d\u000aThis section sets forth the pertinent regional conventions, private and public, governing and \u000d\u000aharmonizing national family law. Most of the regional private law conventions involve European States. \u000d\u000aThe relevant provisions, if any, of the various regional public law conventions, establish another \u000d\u000alayer of human rights protection. The most important regional conventions for purposes of IFL include the \u000d\u000aEuropean Convention on Human Rights, the Inter-American Convention on Human Rights, and the African \u000d\u000aCharter on the Rights and Welfare of Children. The European Convention has been useful in protecting the \u000d\u000arights of sexual minorities, particularly gays, lesbians and transgendered persons. The Inter-American \u000d\u000aConvention has been used to establish State responsibility in connection with domestic violence. The \u000d\u000aAfrican Charter restricts intercountry adoption in Africa, explicitly preferring institutionalization in the \u000d\u000achild\u2019s country of origin to intercountry adoption. Where there are no feasible alternatives, intercountry \u000d\u000aadoption may be considered, but even then, it is limited to those countries which are also parties to the \u000d\u000aCharter or to the CRC. This has recently been challenged under the South African Constitution. \u000d\u000aNational Implementation \u000d\u000aThis section considers the national implementation of international norms. Implementing \u000d\u000alegislation may be required in those States, like the United Kingdom and the United States, which do not \u000d\u000aincorporate international treaties as part of domestic law. Implementing legislation may be useful even in \u000d\u000athose States which do incorporate treaties, since it enables the State to tailor the treaty to national \u000d\u000acircumstances. \u000d\u000aIn addition, national laws often function on both a national (or federal) and a local level. While \u000d\u000acooperation with a local lawyer will probably be necessary, an overview of the national family law system \u000d\u000amay facilitate such cooperation. The U.S. State Department maintains some useful sites, e.g., \u000d\u000ahttp://travel.state.gove/abduct.html (International Parental Child Abduction, with links to Application for \u000d\u000aAssistance; Booklet, Islamic Family Law, Judicial Education), and country-specific flyers. \u000d\u000aConflicts questions are apt to be decided under the national conflicts law of the State asserting \u000d\u000ajurisdiction. As in the domestic sphere, forum non conveniens arguments may sometimes prevail. In \u000d\u000ageneral, however, the foreign State is likely to retain jurisdiction where it believes that the issue raises \u000d\u000aimportant public policy concerns. Deference to foreign law, reasonably expected in a commercial context, \u000d\u000ais more elusive when matters involving highly-charged family issues are at stake. \u000d\u000aIOs and NGOs \u000d\u000aThe last section describes some of the roles played by non-State actors in IFL. International \u000d\u000aorganizations (IOs), that is, organizations comprised of States such as the United Nations or UNIFEM, \u000d\u000aoften exert a strong influence in this area. As discussed in Chapter 6, for example, UNIFEM has established \u000d\u000aan internet working group to end violence against women. This represents a broad-based effort, which \u000d\u000acoordinates strategies involving education, training, mobilization, and changing male behavior. The World ","Chapter 1: International Family Law Page 9\u000d\u000aHealth Organization (\u2018WHO\u2019), similarly, has supported efforts throughout the world to educate teenagers \u000d\u000aand young adults about reproduction and different forms of birth control. \u000d\u000aNon-governmental organizations (NGOs) are also increasingly important in lobbying for and \u000d\u000araising consciousness about family law issues. The European Women\u2019s Lobby, for example, has taken \u000d\u000astrong positions on a number of issues from domestic violence to family leave. Non-State actors play \u000d\u000aimportant roles in establishing, maintaining, enforcing and challenging family law norms. In addition to \u000d\u000aNGOs, these may include religious and local communities which shape and support cultural norms. As \u000d\u000anoted above, for example, in some States family law is explicitly left to religious authorities. Cultural \u000d\u000anorms, such as the son\u2019s responsibility for aged parents in China and parts of India, may undermine or even \u000d\u000anegate more formal law. ","Chapter 2: Marriage Page 10\u000d\u000aSECTION 2.1: RECOGNITION OF FOREIGN MARRIAGES\u000d\u000aInternational Family Law Practice\u000d\u000aDatabase updated July 2020\u000d\u000aJeremy D. Morley\u000d\u000a(citations omitted)\u000d\u000a\u00a7 2:1. Introduction\u000d\u000aInternational family lawyers may be presented with various issues concerning the validity of international \u000d\u000amarriages.\u000d\u000aWhether or not a couple was legally married may have extremely significant consequences since many \u000d\u000arights, duties, and privileges stem from the status of marriage. The financial consequences of a marital \u000d\u000arelationship may concern such matters as the division of the parties' real and personal property upon divorce, \u000d\u000aas well as the right to receive and the obligation to pay spousal support. Inheritance rights also often hinge \u000d\u000aon the status of marriage. Furthermore, a married person might be charged with bigamy for going through \u000d\u000aa form of marriage with a third party and will be unable to remarry unless and until an existing marriage is \u000d\u000adissolved by divorce.\u000d\u000aMarriage also has vast significance for immigration purposes, but this chapter does not deal with the special \u000d\u000aaspects of immigration law that apply to the definition of marriage.\u000d\u000aAs with other aspects of international family law there is no international law of any significance that \u000d\u000agoverns the validity of marriages. The Hague Conference on Private International Law adopted the Hague \u000d\u000aConvention of 14 March 1978 on Celebration and Recognition of the Validity of Marriages, but it has been \u000d\u000aratified by no more than three countries (not the United States). \u000d\u000aAccordingly, issues as to the validity of marriages are resolved by each forum under its own rules. This \u000d\u000ameans that the simple question, \u201cAre they married?\u201d cannot always be answered with a simple \u201cyes\u201d or \u000d\u000a\u201cno.\u201d \u201cIt depends\u201d is sometimes the appropriate answer. What it depends on primarily is the perspective \u000d\u000afrom which the question is being asked. A marriage might be valid in one jurisdiction and invalid in another. \u000d\u000aFor example, a polygamous marriage that takes place in India between Egyptian nationals will be perfectly \u000d\u000avalid in many countries, may well be granted recognition in Western countries such as Britain, but will \u000d\u000alikely be refused recognition in the United States. Similar global variations occur from country to country \u000d\u000awith respect to marriages alleged to be underage marriages, forced marriages, and incestuous marriages, as \u000d\u000awell as to same sex marriages.\u000d\u000aThis chapter will cover the basic rules that courts in the United States apply to resolve such issues and the \u000d\u000arole of public policy in regulating and limiting the effect to the basic rules as applied by American courts.\u000d\u000aIn many cases, the validity of a marriage depends on whether the prior divorce of one of the parties is \u000d\u000arecognized. See Chapter 5 for a discussion of this issue where the divorce was from a foreign court.\u000d\u000a\u00a7 2:2. Law of country where marriage occurred\u2014Basic rule\u000d\u000aCourts in the United States generally apply the laws of the country in which a marriage took place to \u000d\u000adetermine its validity. Many courts still refer to the rule by its Latin name as the lex loci ","Chapter 2: Marriage Page 11\u000d\u000acelebrationis. Unlike some other common law countries, this rule usually applies not only to formal validity \u000d\u000a(that is, whether the required formalities were complied with), but also to the substantial validity of the \u000d\u000amarriage, which is whether the parties had the capacity to conclude a valid marriage. \u000d\u000aIn practice, the impact of the rule is very greatly ameliorated by three devices that courts may choose to \u000d\u000aapply in any particular case.\u000d\u000aFirst, there is a strong presumption in favor of the legality of marriages. The application of this presumption \u000d\u000aenables courts in appropriate cases to overlook violations of foreign laws. \u000d\u000aSecond, whenever they deem it appropriate, courts may choose instead to apply the local law of the state \u000d\u000awhich has the most significant relationship to the spouses. \u000d\u000aThird, courts may apply considerations of public policy to validate or invalidate marriages as they see \u000d\u000afit. Since marriage is a social institution, and historically a religious institution, decisions concerning the \u000d\u000avalidity of particular kinds of marriage and the validity of marriage between particular kinds of people have \u000d\u000aan impact on society at large. International marriages are obviously more likely to raise such issues than \u000d\u000apurely domestic marriages. In such circumstances judges are called on to decide whether a public policy in \u000d\u000athe local jurisdiction is sufficiently threatened by the marriage as would require that the marriage be \u000d\u000adeclared void.\u000d\u000aThe rule that the law of the foreign country normally has preeminence applies without regard to the actual \u000d\u000astate of relations between the U.S. and the foreign country in which the marriage occurred. For example, \u000d\u000aan American court must fully respect a marriage that took place in Iran, and must dispassionately determine \u000d\u000aand apply Iran's law, even if the U.S. has no diplomatic relations with Iran. See Ghassemi v. Ghassemi, 998 \u000d\u000aSo. 2d 731 (La. Ct. App. 1st Cir. 2008).\u000d\u000a\u00a7 2:3. Law of country where marriage occurred\u2014Application of the rule\u000d\u000aThe rule that the validity of a marriage is generally determined by applying the laws of the country where \u000d\u000athe marriage was undertaken has been applied in many circumstances.\u000d\u000aThe first step is to identify the country in which the purported marriage took place. While that issue is \u000d\u000aperfectly obvious in most cases, there are some marriages that take place in more than one location. \u000d\u000aIn Farah v. Farah, 429 S.E.2d 626 (Ca. Ct. App. 1993), the Virginia courts struggled with just such a case \u000d\u000athat concerned a three-part international Muslim marriage. A Muslim couple from Algeria and Pakistan \u000d\u000alived in Virginia and that is where they signed their Islamic marriage contract (the nikah). The marriage \u000d\u000awas solemnized a few days later by the appointed representatives of the couple at an Islamic ceremony that \u000d\u000awas held in England. The formal wedding reception (the rukhsati) was held in Pakistan, which included the \u000d\u000aritual of the bride's father \u201csending her away\u201d with her husband. The parties then returned to live in Virginia. \u000d\u000aThey separated a year later. The trial court held that the marriage had occurred in Pakistan. The Virginia \u000d\u000aCourt of Appeal overturned that ruling. It held that the reception had no legal significance in Islamic law \u000d\u000aand that the marriage was \u201cperformed\u201d in England, not Pakistan.\u000d\u000aOnce the place of the purported marriage is identified, a party seeking to overturn the presumption of \u000d\u000avalidity of a marriage must present admissible evidence that under the law of that place the marriage is \u000d\u000avoid. However, an Ohio court placed upon the party who claimed that a foreign marriage had taken place ","Chapter 2: Marriage Page 12\u000d\u000aand was valid the entire burden of proving that a Hindu ceremony that took place in India without any civil \u000d\u000aregistration was a valid marriage under the law of India. See Verma v. Verma, 903 N.E.2d 343 (Ohio Ct. \u000d\u000aApp. 2008). The husband claimed that the Indian ceremony was ineffective and that the parties had not \u000d\u000abeen married until they went through a civil ceremony several years later in the U.S. The appeal court \u000d\u000aremanded the case to the trial court with instructions that it must allow the wife to offer a DVD of the \u000d\u000aceremony into evidence as well as take notice of India's Hindu Marriage Act.\u000d\u000aBy contrast, in a case that also raised the issue of the validity of a Hindu marriage in India, a New York \u000d\u000acourt held that a court of law could not rule on the validity of a Hindu marriage entered into in India prior \u000d\u000ato the enactment in India of the Hindu Marriage Act of 1955, which codified Hindu Law relating to marriage \u000d\u000aand divorce, because such a determination required the court to rule on the validity of religious matters in \u000d\u000acontravention of the principle of separation of church and state. See Madireddy v. Madireddy, 66 A.D.3d \u000d\u000a647 (N.Y. Ct. App. 2009). \u000d\u000aIn Farah, the putative husband, seeking to defeat his alleged wife's suit for divorce and financial relief, \u000d\u000aintroduced testimony from a solicitor of the Supreme Court of England and Wales that a marriage performed \u000d\u000ain England is void ab initio unless all statutory formalities of the Marriage Act of England were satisfied. \u000d\u000aThe Act required the issuance of a marriage license, 15-days of residency in England by one of the parties \u000d\u000abefore the marriage, and the issuance of a certificate of marriage by a duly authorized registrar of marriages. \u000d\u000aNone of those formalities had been satisfied. Indeed, the parties did not even travel to England and the \u000d\u000amarriage was by proxy. Accordingly the Virginia court held that the marriage was invalid under Virginia \u000d\u000alaw because it was not conducted in accordance with the statutory requirements of English law, where the \u000d\u000apurported marriage had been performed.\u000d\u000aThis case may be contrasted with a New York case that concerned a proxy marriage that had occurred in \u000d\u000aItaly. See In re Valente's Will, 18 Misc. 2d 701 (N.Y. 1959). Under Italian law proxy marriages were \u000d\u000aperfectly valid. The New York court held that New York would recognize the foreign proxy divorce since \u000d\u000athe marriage was valid under Italian law, where it had occurred and since proxy marriages do not necessarily \u000d\u000aviolate the public policy of New York.\u000d\u000aOn the other hand, when the purported marriage of New Yorkers in Mexico apparently complied with New \u000d\u000aYork procedural requirements but did not comply with the procedural requirements imposed by Mexican \u000d\u000alaw, the marriage was invalid under New York law. See Ponorovskaya v. Stecklow, 45 Misc. 3d 597 (N.Y. \u000d\u000a2014). The New York court explained that New York has long recognized that, barring public policy \u000d\u000aconcerns, the validity of a marriage is determined by the laws of the state or country in which it was \u000d\u000aperformed. However, for reasons specific to New York jurisprudence, the Court also deemed it necessary \u000d\u000ato satisfy itself that the parties neither individually nor collectively could have had a reasonable and justified \u000d\u000aexpectation that they were in fact married. If the parties had had such an expectation, New York law might \u000d\u000ahave superseded the law of Mexico to validate the invalid marriage.\u000d\u000aIn order to determine the validity of a foreign marriage, the U.S. court will be required to determine the \u000d\u000aforeign law applying to the factual scenario and to make decisions as to how that foreign law will apply to \u000d\u000asuch facts. An Ohio court was faced with a claim that South Korea permitted de facto marriages \u000d\u000anotwithstanding the fact that the Civil Code of South Korea requires that a marriage take place at a Ward \u000d\u000aOffice where a record is made on the family census register. The proponent of the marriage cited two \u000d\u000aKorean cases that purportedly upheld de facto marriages. The Ohio court disregarded the case law on the \u000d\u000aground that South Korea was a civil law country, so that the provisions of its codes were preeminent. Since ","Chapter 2: Marriage Page 13\u000d\u000athe Civil Code contained a clear requirement for registration, which was not complied with, the putative \u000d\u000amarriage was void. See Lee v. Melanson, 2007 WL 1114012 (Ohio Ct. App. 2007). \u000d\u000aA Congolese traditional marriage by proxy was upheld in Maryland. The husband participated by telephone \u000d\u000ain the ceremony from another country. The spouses subsequently lived in the United States for several years \u000d\u000aand held themselves out as being married to each other. The Maryland Court of Appeals applied a two-step \u000d\u000aapproach: first, the putative wife was required to prove adequately that a valid marriage took place in the \u000d\u000aCongo; then, a determination was required as to whether Maryland should recognize the marriage under \u000d\u000athe doctrine of comity. The Court struggled somewhat with the failure of the putative wife to produce solid \u000d\u000aevidence of the applicable law in the Congo, formerly Zaire. It ultimately ruled that the claims were \u000d\u000asupported by sufficient evidence, including her testimony that the groom had confirmed by telephone that \u000d\u000ahe wanted to be married to her and approved the delivery of a dowry to her, that the parties' families \u000d\u000acelebrated for several hours, and that the traditional ceremony in which she participated was recognized as \u000d\u000aa marriage in the Congo, as well as a document from the embassy of the Congo explaining that it no longer \u000d\u000ahad records for the marriage because of a flood. See Tshiani v. Tshiani, 81 A.3d 414 (Md. Ct. App. 2013). \u000d\u000aA marriage that is void under the law of the foreign country in which it takes place because the parties were \u000d\u000aunderage or did not have the required consent of a parent will generally be deemed void under the law of \u000d\u000aan American forum, at least when the parties were domiciled in the foreign country. For that reason, an \u000d\u000aIllinois court declared that an Italian marriage between a 13-year-old and a 15-year-old was invalid, based \u000d\u000aupon the testimony of the Italian consul in Chicago, who was qualified as an expert in Italian law, that such \u000d\u000aa marriage was void under that law. Canale v. People, 52 N.E. 310 (Ill. Ct. App. 1898).\u000d\u000aThere is authority for the proposition that whether a family member has standing to assert the invalidity of \u000d\u000aa foreign marriage should be determined by applying the law of the foreign country where the marriage \u000d\u000atook place. In re Estate of Crane, 2010 WL 935651 (Mich. Ct. App. 2010).\u000d\u000aThe rule that the validity of a marriage is generally determined by applying the laws of the country where \u000d\u000athe marriage was undertaken means that a marriage that is valid in the place where it occurred but would \u000d\u000ahave been void if it had taken place in the forum state, should normally be deemed valid. This is particularly \u000d\u000aso when the spouses were domiciled in the place where they married.\u000d\u000aFor this reason a New York court refused to invalidate a West Indies marriage between young people who \u000d\u000alived at the time of their marriage in the West Indies and who later moved to New York. See Simmons v. \u000d\u000aSimmons, 208 A.D. 195 (N.Y. Ct. App. 1924). They were over the age of consent under the law of the \u000d\u000aplace of the marriage but not under New York law. Indeed, even though they were still under the New York \u000d\u000aage of consent at the time they moved to New York as man and wife, the fact that the law of the place of \u000d\u000atheir marriage did not invalidate their marriage rendered it perfectly lawful in New York.\u000d\u000a\u00a7 2:4. Presumption of validity\u000d\u000aOnce some evidence of a foreign marriage has been adduced there is generally a strong presumption that \u000d\u000athe marriage is valid. The burden of proof rests firmly upon the objecting party to overcome the presumption \u000d\u000aand to produce solid evidence that the foreign law does indeed render the marriage void. \u000d\u000aNew York courts have found that religious marriages that took place in France and Canada, one Orthodox \u000d\u000aJewish and the other Hindu, were valid even though both countries had laws that criminalized the conduct ","Chapter 2: Marriage Page 14\u000d\u000aof the people who performed the ceremonies without compliance with civil wedding requirements. The \u000d\u000acourts relied on the fact that where persons live and cohabit as husband and wife, and are reputed to be \u000d\u000asuch, a presumption arises that they have been legally married, and this presumption, especially in a case \u000d\u000ainvolving legitimacy, can be rebutted only by the most cogent and satisfactory evidence.\u000d\u000aIn a case in Washington State, there was conflicting evidence as to whether the parties were married under \u000d\u000athe law of Sudan, which was rendered especially difficult to resolve given the instability in that country. \u000d\u000aThe parties certainly had intended to marry and they had received the blessing of their local authority, had \u000d\u000aconsummated the marriage, and the man had substantially paid the dowry. However there was testimony \u000d\u000athat since the dowry had not been paid in full (only 35 cows instead of the agreed 50), the marriage was \u000d\u000ainvalid under Sudanese law. The Court determined that a valid \u201ccultural\u201d marriage had taken place, but not \u000d\u000aa valid civil marriage, thereby overcoming a stepfather's attempt to claim presumption of paternity of a \u000d\u000achild based on the alleged invalidity of the marriage. In re Marriage of Akon, 248 P.3d 94 (Wash Ct. App. \u000d\u000a2011).\u000d\u000aOn the other hand, where the evidence indicates that the requirements of foreign law were not completely \u000d\u000acomplied with because a party was not willing to consent to the marriage, the courts have been far more \u000d\u000aprepared to invalidate the foreign marriage. For this reason a New York court declared that a Hindu wedding \u000d\u000aceremony in India was a nullity. The marriage had been arranged by the parties' parents without the consent \u000d\u000aof either party. The woman had refused to take seven steps around a sacred fire, which was a necessary part \u000d\u000aof the ceremony, although repeatedly urged by the priest and her father to do so, because she was in love \u000d\u000awith someone else and did not want to marry the plaintiff. The court found that the ceremony had not been \u000d\u000acompleted and annulled the marriage. See Singh v. Singh, 67 Misc. 2d 878 (N.Y. 1971).\u000d\u000aIn immigration cases, the presumption in favor of validity of a marriage may be inapplicable. Thus the Sixth \u000d\u000aCircuit found that, although there was written evidence that the Israeli Ministry of the Interior had a \u000d\u000acertificate confirming a Sharia marriage between a Muslim couple in Jerusalem prior to their entry into the \u000d\u000aUnited States, and even though Israeli law applied Sharia law to such a purported marriage, the government \u000d\u000ahad not offered \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence of the alleged marriage as to compel deportation of the \u000d\u000ahusband under the terms of the governing immigration statute. See Hassan v. Holder, 604 F.3d 915 (6th \u000d\u000aCir. 2010). \u000d\u000a\u00a7 2:5. Common law marriages\u000d\u000aIn some cases, courts have been asked to rule that the relationship of cohabiting partners under a foreign \u000d\u000acountry's law is equivalent to that of common-law marriage under the law of some American states. \u000d\u000aInternational family lawyers should expect that cases of this nature will increase given the trend in many \u000d\u000acountries to afford statutory rights to cohabiting partners and the trend in Europe, for example, for couples \u000d\u000ato live and have children in unmarried but stable \u201cpartnership\u201d relationships.\u000d\u000aThe courts in such cases have examined the foreign laws to determine whether the parties had full marital \u000d\u000arights under those laws. There are many U.S. cases which give recognition to common law marriages \u000d\u000aentered into under the laws of other American states even though the laws of the forum state do not authorize \u000d\u000asuch marriages if entered into in the forum state. For example, a party asserting common-law marriage in \u000d\u000aOklahoma must prove (1) an actual and mutual agreement between spouses to be husband and wife, (2) a \u000d\u000apermanent relationship, (3) an exclusive relationship, accompanied by cohabitation as man and wife, and \u000d\u000a(4) a mutual representation to the public as husband and wife, all by clear and convincing evidence. Most \u000d\u000a(but not all) other U.S. courts will generally recognize such a marriage, provided it can be shown that the ","Chapter 2: Marriage Page 15\u000d\u000anecessary events occurred within the state whose law allows common law marriage. Such recognition will \u000d\u000apresumably extend to foreign common law marriage, provided the status that results is indeed a marriage.\u000d\u000aGenerally, for recognition purposes, the courts have ruled that anything short of marriage does not constitute \u000d\u000amarriage. In one case, a court held that although Israeli law gave statutory rights to parties in long-term \u000d\u000acohabiting relationships, the rights were not marital rights. Matter of Estate of Jenkins, 133 Misc. 2d 420 \u000d\u000a(N.Y. 1986). Likewise, in another case, the court held that the legal status of \u201cconcubinage\u201d under French \u000d\u000alaw was distinct from that of marriage under French law and was not equivalent to common law marriage. \u000d\u000aMatter of Estate of Huyot, 169 Misc. 2d 805 (N.Y. 1996). The petitioner in a third case claimed to be a \u000d\u000adecedent's common law husband under Ontario law, where he and the decedent had lived. In re Estate of \u000d\u000aGernold, 9 Misc. 3d 427 (N.Y. 2005). The New York court examined Ontario law and determined that \u000d\u000aalthough unmarried cohabitants had substantial rights under Ontario statutory law they were significantly \u000d\u000aless extensive than marriage, and in particular did not provide any inheritance rights and did not provide a \u000d\u000aright to take against a will. Accordingly, the case was dismissed.\u000d\u000aSimilarly, a Florida court was asked to rule that the companion of a flight attendant who was killed in \u000d\u000aairplane crash was not her surviving spouse for probate purposes. American Airlines, Inc. v. Mejia, 766 So. \u000d\u000a2d 305 (Fla. Ct. App. 2000). The companion acknowledged that he and the deceased never participated in \u000d\u000aa formal, civil or religious ceremony of marriage, but he contended that in Colombia they lived together, \u000d\u000aowned seven properties together, and had reciprocal wills, all of which entitled them under Colombian law \u000d\u000ato claim the status of \u201cUnion Marital de Hecho.\u201d He asserted that that status was equivalent to a common \u000d\u000alaw marriage in the United States. The Florida court cited Colombia case law holding that there was an \u000d\u000aimmense gap between marriage and a mere union, including most significantly the fact that a union could \u000d\u000abe ended by the mere decision of one of its members. Accordingly, the Florida court ruled that a union under \u000d\u000aColombian law was not the equivalent of common law marriage in the United States.\u000d\u000aThere is a trend internationally towards the expansion of rights to couples who are in committed, long-term \u000d\u000arelationships. Australia provides rights to parties who are in a \u201cde facto relationship,\u201d defined as \u201ca \u000d\u000arelationship between two adult persons: (a) who live together as a couple, and (b) who are not married to \u000d\u000aone another or related by family.\u201d An Australian judgment gave letters of administration to the surviving \u000d\u000apartner in such a de facto relationship, who then asked the courts in New Mexico appoint her as the personal \u000d\u000arepresentative of the decedent's estate. The New Mexico court refused to do so. It held that the surviving \u000d\u000apartner was not a \u201csurviving spouse\u201d within the meaning of New Mexico law because, under the Australian \u000d\u000astatute, a de facto relationship was not a true marital relationship and because the relationship between the \u000d\u000acouple \u201cwas not equivalent to a common law marriage\u201d under New Mexico law.\u000d\u000aCourts have uniformly applied the same rule to hold that concubinage relationships in Mexico should not \u000d\u000abe recognized as marriages. \u000d\u000aBy contrast, a Ghanaian customary marriage was held to bear great similarity to a common law marriage \u000d\u000aand was upheld accordingly. \u000d\u000a\u00a7 2:6. Law of country of most significant relationship\u000d\u000aWhile the Restatement Second, Conflict of Laws presents the rule that a marriage is universally recognized \u000d\u000aas valid if it satisfies the requirements of the state where the marriage is contracted (unless there is a \u000d\u000aviolation of public policy), the Restatement also provides that the validity of a marriage will be determined ","Chapter 2: Marriage Page 16\u000d\u000aby the local law of the state which, with respect to the particular issue, has the most significant relationship \u000d\u000ato the spouses. \u000d\u000aAccordingly, even if a foreign marriage is void under the laws of the country where it took place, an \u000d\u000aAmerican court might uphold the validity of the marriage if the parties were most closely connected with \u000d\u000athat state. The place of most significant connection is often the state where at least one of the spouses was \u000d\u000adomiciled at the time of the marriage and where both spouses made their home after the marriage.\u000d\u000aThis provided the basis for an Arizona court to validate a marriage that took place in Mexico between two \u000d\u000avacationing residents of Arizona and who then returned to live in Arizona. See Donlann v. Macgurn, 55 \u000d\u000aP.3d 74 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2002). The marriage was invalid under Mexican law because the wedding ceremony \u000d\u000awas not performed by a civil registry official. The court chose Arizona law to govern the issue and \u000d\u000adetermined that if the marriage had been performed in Arizona it would have been valid under Arizona law.\u000d\u000aHowever, that case was distinguished in another case in Arizona in which the court ruled that that state does \u000d\u000anot determine the validity of a marriage based on the law of the jurisdiction with the most significant \u000d\u000arelationship. It held that the validity of a marriage should be determined by the law of the place of the \u000d\u000amarriage unless strong public policy exceptions require otherwise. Thus, when parties who were domiciled \u000d\u000ain Mexico at the time of the wife's death had married in Arizona, the validity of the marriage was governed \u000d\u000aby Arizona law, under which the marriage was void ab initio because the purported husband was already \u000d\u000amarried when the alleged marriage took place. See In re Estate of Rodriguez, 160 P.3d 679 (Ariz. Ct. App. \u000d\u000a2007).\u000d\u000a\u00a7 2:7. Public policy\u2014Marriage between family members\u000d\u000aThe public policy exception to the basic rules concerning the validity of foreign marriages is difficult to \u000d\u000aapply since it always entails a clash between two policies. The first is that the state's public policies on a \u000d\u000aparticular issue should be respected. The second policy is that comity should be afforded to foreign laws \u000d\u000aand judicial decisions.\u000d\u000aA New Mexico court upheld an award of custody to the mother of three children residing in New Mexico \u000d\u000aand their relocation to California. See Leszinske v. Poole, 798 P.2d 1049 (N.M. Ct. App. 1990). The mother \u000d\u000ahad married her uncle in Costa Rica. Such uncle-niece marriages were illegal in New Mexico and California \u000d\u000abut were legal in Costa Rica. The court placed great significance on the fact that they were legal in 23 South \u000d\u000aand Central American and Northern European nations. The court also determined that the fact the court \u000d\u000abelow had found that it was in the best interests of the children that they reside in California with the mother \u000d\u000aand her uncle was of crucial significance. For these reasons, the marriage did not sufficiently offend the \u000d\u000astrong public policy of New Mexico as to outweigh the purposes served by the rule of comity.\u000d\u000aA Connecticut court held otherwise in a case concerning a marriage which took place in Italy between an \u000d\u000aItalian citizen and his niece, where such marriages were lawful. See Catalano v. Catalano, 170 A.2d 726 \u000d\u000a(Conn. Ct. App. 1961). The court declared that, since Connecticut's policy towards such \u201cincest\u201d was so \u000d\u000aserious that it was penalized by substantial imprisonment, it must hold that the woman was not married and \u000d\u000atherefore could not qualify for a Connecticut widow's allowance.\u000d\u000aMost recently, a Louisiana court was asked to grant a divorce and distribution of marital property for an \u000d\u000aIranian marriage between first cousins. Ghassemi v. Ghassemi, 998 So. 2d 731 (La. Ct. App. 1st Cir. 2008).\u000d\u000aThe marriage was legal in Iran but Louisiana law bars marriage between first cousins. A Louisiana statute \u000d\u000aprovides that foreign marriages should be recognized, even if they would otherwise be illegal, unless they ","Chapter 2: Marriage Page 17\u000d\u000aviolate \u201ca strong public policy\u201d of Louisiana. Accordingly, the court was required to measure the \u201cstrength\u201d \u000d\u000aof Louisiana's policy against first-cousin marriage. The court considered:\u000d\u000a\u25cf The fact that the Louisiana Legislature had not expressly outlawed marriages between first cousins \u000d\u000aregardless of where they are contracted, as it has emphatically done in the case of purported same-sex \u000d\u000amarriages;\u000d\u000a\u25cf The fact that marriage to first cousins was not prohibited in Louisiana until 1902;\u000d\u000a\u25cf \u201cNatural law,\u201d which purportedly is only violated by marriages between those in the direct lineal line of \u000d\u000aconsanguinity or between brothers and sisters;\u000d\u000a\u25cf The Bible's Book of Leviticus, \u201cthe font of Western incest laws,\u201d which does not prohibit first-cousin \u000d\u000amarriages;\u000d\u000a\u25cf The views of other U.S. states, of which about half allow some or all first-cousin marriages;\u000d\u000a\u25cf The fact that even other states that prohibit marriages between first cousins, have nonetheless found that \u000d\u000asuch marriages do not violate public policy; and\u000d\u000a\u25cf The fact that among \u201cwestern countries\u201d the U.S. was unique in restricting first cousin marriages.\u000d\u000aUpon its review of these factors, the court found that marriages of first cousins were not so odious as to \u000d\u000aviolate the strong public policy of Louisiana. \u000d\u000a\u00a7 2:9. Public policy\u2014Same-sex marriages\u000d\u000aThe issue of the recognition of same-sex marriages was settled by the U.S. Supreme Court decision \u000d\u000ain Obergefell v. Hodges. There, the Court held that\u000d\u000athe right to marry is a fundamental right inherent in the liberty of the \u000d\u000aperson, and under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the \u000d\u000aFourteenth Amendment couples of the same-sex may not be deprived of \u000d\u000athat right and that liberty. The Court now holds that same-sex couples may \u000d\u000aexercise the fundamental right to marry. No longer may this liberty be \u000d\u000adenied to them.\u000d\u000aThe Supreme Court therefore held invalid state laws defining marriage as a union between one man and \u000d\u000aone woman \u201cto the extent they exclude same-sex couples from civil marriage on the same terms and \u000d\u000aconditions as opposite-sex couples.\u201d\u000d\u000aThe Court also addressed \u201cwhether the Constitution requires States to recognize same-sex marriages validly \u000d\u000aperformed out of State\u201d and concluded that \u201cthe recognition bans inflict substantial and continuing harm \u000d\u000aon same-sex couples.\u201d Accordingly, the Court held that\u000d\u000asame-sex couples may exercise the fundamental right to marry in all \u000d\u000aStates. It follows that the Court also must hold\u2014and it now does hold\u2014\u000d\u000athat there is no lawful basis for a State to refuse to recognize a lawful same-","Chapter 2: Marriage Page 18\u000d\u000asex marriage performed in another State on the ground of its same-sex \u000d\u000acharacter.\u000d\u000aThus, the holding in Obergefell requires U.S. state courts to recognize the validity of same-sex marriages \u000d\u000aentered into in foreign countries if such marriages are validly entered into in such countries.\u000d\u000aAccordingly, the Michigan Supreme Court remanded the prior ruling of a lower appellate court that had \u000d\u000aheld that the plaintiff was not a parent under Michigan's equitable parent doctrine even though she and the \u000d\u000abiological mother had at all relevant times been married under Canadian law. Stankevich v. Milliron, 868 \u000d\u000aN.W.2d 907 (Mich. 2015). On remand, it was held that once it was determined that the parties were married \u000d\u000ain Canada in 2007 and that defendant's biological child was born during the course of that marriage, then, \u000d\u000asince Obergefell requires that same-sex couples be permitted to exercise the fundamental right to marry on \u000d\u000athe same terms and conditions as opposite-sex couples, plaintiff had standing to seek the status of an \u000d\u000aequitable parent.\u000d\u000a\u00a7 2:10. Public policy\u2014Other issues\u000d\u000aCourts will sometimes apply public policy to nullify the marriages of children who are under the age for \u000d\u000amarriage in the forum state, even when such marriages are legal in the foreign country where they occurred. \u000d\u000aA New Jersey court annulled an allegedly unconsummated marriage in Italy between a 16-year-old New \u000d\u000aJersey resident and an Italian man where the girl returned to the United States five months after the marriage \u000d\u000aand the man did nothing to enforce any marital rights for two years. The court may have been influenced \u000d\u000aby the fact that the man's lawyer told the court that his client wanted his wife to return to Italy \u201cto stomp \u000d\u000agrapes and make cheese.\u201d \u000d\u000aAnother area where public policy issues will likely come before American courts is that of forced marriages \u000d\u000awhich usually involve minors. A \u201cforced marriage\u201d is one in which a party is married without his or her \u000d\u000aconsent or against his or her will. It is still practiced in South Asia, the Middle East, and Africa, as well as \u000d\u000awithin migrant communities from such areas in Europe and the United States. A new British law allows \u000d\u000acivil courts to issue restraining orders\u2014known as forced marriage orders\u2014to stop forced marriages from \u000d\u000aoccurring and to protect victims. The subject of an order can include any person who aids, abets, or \u000d\u000aencourages the forced marriage. Interested third parties, such as counselors or teachers, may apply \u000d\u000athemselves for court permission to intervene on behalf of victims who are too fearful to seek help on their \u000d\u000aown. It is inconceivable that an American court would uphold a foreign marriage to which one of the \u000d\u000aspouses had not consented, though there is no authority yet on point. Among the authorities that would \u000d\u000adoubtless be cited in support of such a ruling is Article 16(2) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, \u000d\u000awhich provides that, \u201cMarriage shall be entered into only with the free and full consent of the intending \u000d\u000aspouses.\u201d","Chapter 2: Marriage Page 19\u000d\u000aSECTION 2.2: MARRIAGE \u000d\u000aInternational Family Law: An Introduction\u000d\u000aBarbara Stark\u000d\u000a1. The Problem \u000d\u000aJulia and Amitabh met when both were students at the London School of Economics. Julia is a \u000d\u000acitizen of the U.K. and an agnostic; Ami is a citizen of India and a Hindu. They fell in love and decided to \u000d\u000amarry. Julia wanted to marry in the Savoy Hotel in London. Ami wanted to marry in his village in India. \u000d\u000aThey agreed to do both. \u000d\u000aAfter a joyful wedding at the Savoy, they wrote to Ami\u2019s Uncle in India and asked him to arrange \u000d\u000aa wedding for them there. Ami\u2019s parents had died in an earthquake when he was 8 and he had been raised \u000d\u000aby his Uncle, who had quickly sent him off to boarding school in the U.K. Ami and Julia have just received \u000d\u000athe following letter from his Uncle: \u000d\u000aMy Dear Nephew, I am very sorry to be the one to have to tell you this, but you should \u000d\u000aprobably reconsider your desire to return to Rajasthan for your wedding. You were in fact married here 18 \u000d\u000ayears ago, when you were just four years old. Your wife, Ratna, was sent to your father\u2019s house when she \u000d\u000awas 11, but you had already left for boarding school when you were 9. The dowry was paid in full and I \u000d\u000anever heard of any action for divorce or annulment. I do not know where she went when your parents \u000d\u000adied. \u000d\u000aI look forward to seeing you soon, but it would probably be unwise to attempt to marry \u000d\u000ahere. Your Fond Uncle \u000d\u000aAmi and Julia come to you. Assuming that his Uncle\u2019s statements are true, how does this affect \u000d\u000atheir marriage in London? How does it affect their planned marriage in India? Does Ami have any \u000d\u000aobligation to Ratna? What are his options? \u000d\u000a2. Overview \u000d\u000aAnthropologists agree that the institution of marriage began as a way to connect the families of the \u000d\u000abride and groom. It was usually arranged between the families and often accompanied by an exchange of \u000d\u000aproperty (usually from the wife\u2019s family to that of the husband, in the form of a \u2018bride price\u2019 or \u2018dowry\u2019) \u000d\u000aand the formation of alliances. In patriarchal societies, a young woman or girl would leave her family and \u000d\u000ajoin that of her husband. \u000d\u000aThe modern notion of companionate marriage is very different. It also involves a long-term \u000d\u000acommitment between a man and a woman, but it is a relationship which they enter into voluntarily. Unlike \u000d\u000atraditional marriage, modern marriage resembles a partnership, a relationship of equals. Many women in \u000d\u000asuch marriages, for example, work outside the home. They are more likely to have some degree of economic \u000d\u000aindependence, accordingly, although they usually earn less than their husbands. \u000d\u000aBoth kinds of marriages may be found throughout the world. Traditional marriages endure in \u000d\u000atraditional societies, such as Pakistan. They may also be found throughout Africa, parts of Asia, and the \u000d\u000aMiddle East alongside modern marriages. In rural areas in Kenya, for example, traditional marriages persist \u000d\u000awhile modern marriages are more common in the more cosmopolitan cities. Modern marriages are most \u000d\u000acommon in the industrialized North, although more traditional groups within those societies may opt for \u000d\u000asome form of traditional marriage. Among fundamentalist religious groups, such as Christian Mormons in \u000d\u000athe United States or Orthodox Jews in Israel, for example, traditional marriage is often favored. \u000d\u000aA crucial function of both traditional and modern marriage is to establish a stable framework in \u000d\u000awhich children will be cared for and supported, emotionally as well as financially. Marriage rates are falling \u000d\u000ain some regions, however, especially in northern Europe. This reflects, in part, a growing number of couples ","Chapter 2: Marriage Page 20\u000d\u000awho choose to live together without marrying. As discussed in Chapters 8-10, increasing numbers of \u000d\u000achildren are born out of wedlock. In addition, a growing, but still small, number of couples opt for \u2018child \u000d\u000afree\u2019 marriages in the industrialized North. In the developing South, in contrast, barrenness is often a ground \u000d\u000afor annulment or divorce. \u000d\u000aMany States recognize multiple forms of marriage, including religious and civil marriages. \u000d\u000aTraditional marriages usually involve a religious ceremony, while modern marriage is often entered into \u000d\u000athrough a secular, civil ceremony. Czechoslovakia, for example, recognizes civil as well as religious forms \u000d\u000aof marriage, but both require a procedure before a civil registrar. India recognizes several different forms \u000d\u000aof marriage. Under Hindu law, marriage is viewed as a sacrament, in contrast to Muslim law, under which \u000d\u000amarriage is regarded as a contract. The Special Marriage Act authorizes some interreligious civil marriages. \u000d\u000aThe 1937 Arya Marriage Validation Act recognizes the legality of intercaste marriages. The 1955 Hindu \u000d\u000aMarriages Act, which applies to any person in India who is not a Muslim, Christian, Parsi, or Jew, \u000d\u000aestablishes the legal parameters of Hindu marriage, and prohibits bigamy as well as certain degrees of \u000d\u000aconsanguinity. \u000d\u000aPrerequisites \u000d\u000aThe prerequisites to marriage fall into three categories: eligibility, consent, and formalities. In \u000d\u000ageneral, States determine who is eligible to enter into marriage, and require freely given consent (although\u000d\u000athe \u2018consent\u2019 required may be that of the heads of the families rather than that of the parties). In addition, \u000d\u000aStates often require some ceremony, registration or similar formality to distinguish marriage from other \u000d\u000arelationships and to impress this distinction upon the parties as well as their families and their communities. \u000d\u000a\u2018Eligibility\u2019 refers to a wide range of factors. Most States impose limits based on their laws on \u000d\u000aconsanguinity; that is, laws which incorporate incest taboos and prohibit close relatives from marrying, \u000d\u000aalthough \u2018close\u2019 has different meanings in different cultures. In Asia, for example, marriages between \u000d\u000acousins are common while in most parts of the United States such marriages are void. Virtually all States \u000d\u000arequire that the spouses be different genders. While most States impose some age limit, this ranges from \u000d\u000a\u2018puberty\u2019 (which may be deemed to begin as early as nine years for girls) to 18 or 21 years. Some countries \u000d\u000aallow different ages for men and women. Others, such as the U.S. and Germany, require both parties to be \u000d\u000aat least 18, unless they have the consent of their parents. \u000d\u000aReforms in traditional societies often involve raising the marriage age. Under traditional Islamic \u000d\u000alaw, for example, no minimum age is established. In codifying their marriage laws, however, several \u000d\u000aIslamic States have set a minimum age at which consent is valid. In Jordan, for example, the man must be \u000d\u000a16 and the woman 15. Other traditional societies have similarly reformed their marriage laws. In Botswana, \u000d\u000afor example, the Marriage Bill 2000 establishes 18 as the minimum age for women as well as men to marry \u000d\u000ain order to conform to contemporary human rights instruments. \u000d\u000aFormer colonial powers, such as the U.K., also set minimum ages for marriage. In India and\u000d\u000aPakistan, for example, the Child Marriage Restraint Act of 1929 set a minimum of 18 years for girls and 21 \u000d\u000ayears for boys for contracting marriage. The Act also sought to deter arranged child marriages by punishing \u000d\u000athe parents or guardians who arranged them. The Act does not, however, invalidate the resulting marriage. \u000d\u000aMost non-Muslim States require that a person be unmarried in order to be eligible for marriage. \u000d\u000aThat is, most prohibit bigamy, and a prior existing marriage is a bar to a new one. Several Muslim States, \u000d\u000ahowever, permit polygamy, the practice of allowing a husband to marry more than one wife. Under some \u000d\u000ainterpretations of Islamic law, a husband may marry up to four wives. Polyandry, in which a woman has \u000d\u000amore than one husband, is rare. It is said to persist in certain remote regions of Tibet, where an elder brother \u000d\u000amay share his wife with his younger brothers. \u000d\u000aAdditional eligibility requirements may be imposed by religious laws or other customs. Some \u000d\u000areligious laws, for example, require that the spouses be of the same religion. Customs that remain \u000d\u000aentrenched in certain societies, in some cases notwithstanding a legal bar, include: the requirement that a \u000d\u000awoman not marry below her own caste (certain Hindu castes in India), that the woman be a virgin (Iran and \u000d\u000aSaudi Arabia), and that a bride-price, or dowry be paid (Botswana). In general, as part of the marriage ","Chapter 2: Marriage Page 21\u000d\u000acontract under Islamic law, the husband pays a dower, or mahr, to the wife. This is paid in cash or in kind \u000d\u000aand is the wife\u2019s sole property (El Alami and Hinchcliff, 1996). \u000d\u000aConsent requirements refer to the consent of the spouses\u2019 families in traditional marriages or to \u000d\u000aconsent of the spouses in a modern marriage. Under Muslim law, a woman who has not been married before \u000d\u000aneeds a guardian (wali) before she can enter into marriage. The wali\u2019s authority varies under the \u000d\u000ainterpretations of the different schools of Islam. Under the Hanafi view, for example, the wali advises the \u000d\u000agirl who has reached puberty and tries to guide her in the decision making process. In Maliki, Shaf\u2019i and \u000d\u000aHanbali law, in contrast, a woman may never finalize her own marriage contract. \u000d\u000aIn the West, consent requirements are satisfied by the parties\u2019 sworn statements that they are \u000d\u000aentering into the marriage voluntarily, along with the absence of any obvious condition vitiating such \u000d\u000aconsent. In the state of Georgia in the U.S., for example, drunkenness at the time of the marriage by either \u000d\u000aspouse may be used to show that the marriage was not in fact consensual. \u000d\u000aOne underlying purpose of formalities is to assure that the parties\u2019 marital status is known to the \u000d\u000acommunity and to the public at large. Ceremonies often reflect the traditional importance of marriage. \u000d\u000aHindu ceremonies, for example, can last for days, but short versions with English translations are available \u000d\u000aon the Internet for contemporary British Hindus. The mix of customary and modern law which characterizes \u000d\u000amany States\u2019 systems is often expressed in the ceremony itself. In Israel, for example, although civil \u000d\u000amarriage is available, it is virtually unknown, the overwhelming majority of couples opting instead for \u000d\u000a\u2018white weddings\u2019 which include a religious ceremony. \u000d\u000aFormalities may also include the requirement that the couple register with a government authority. \u000d\u000aIn India, for example, the Compulsory Registration of Marriage Act passed in 2002 provides a means of \u000d\u000amonitoring child marriages or bigamist marriages. Several smaller Indian states, including Rajasthan, have \u000d\u000adeclined to require compulsory registration because of the continuing popularity of child marriages. In \u000d\u000a1993, a UNICEF survey in Rajasthan found that 50% of the population had married before the age of 15 \u000d\u000aand 17% of this group were under the age of 10. \u000d\u000aIn some countries, such as France, China, and Japan, registration is considered extremely important.\u000d\u000aIn Japan and France, accurate record-keeping ensures the integrity of family lineage. In China, registration \u000d\u000ais necessary in order to qualify for State benefits, which may include housing and education. In other \u000d\u000acountries, failure to register may be regarded as a mere oversight with no legal consequences for the parties. \u000d\u000aConsequences \u000d\u000aMarriage affects the parties\u2019 personal status. Marital status has public consequences, such as \u000d\u000anationality or citizenship status, eligibility for insurance coverage, entitlement to social security, intestacy, \u000d\u000aand inheritance rules. Marital status also has private, social consequences, such as the recognition by the \u000d\u000acommunity of the couple as a household unit. \u000d\u000aMarriage may also involve contractual obligations between the husband and wife. The contractual \u000d\u000aaspects of the parties\u2019 relationship often includes support obligations, either mutual or unilateral, and other \u000d\u000aexpectations, such as sexual fidelity and the establishment of a household, including children. In the U.S., \u000d\u000afor example, the husband was historically required to support the wife and provide her with \u2018necessaries\u2019, \u000d\u000asuch as food and shelter. This obligation is now viewed as a mutual obligation; that is, either spouse may \u000d\u000abe required to support the other. Under traditional Islamic law, similarly, the husband was required to \u000d\u000asupport the wife as long as she submitted to his control. Under recent codifications, the obligation has been \u000d\u000amade gender-neutral. Under the codified law of Libya, adopted in 1984, a wife \u2018who is wealthy shall be \u000d\u000arequired to support her husband . . . during [his] hardship.\u2019 Under Islamic law, marriage is viewed as a civil \u000d\u000acontract, and either party, in theory, may stipulate the terms. In some countries, such as Nigeria, breach of \u000d\u000athe obligation of fidelity by the woman is considered a crime, even if it is involuntary. Adultery by the \u000d\u000awoman, which may include rape, may be punishable by death. In other States sexual infidelity is considered \u000d\u000aa breach of the agreement between the parties, rather than a criminal offense against the State. Thus, \u000d\u000aadultery may be grounds for divorce (see Chapter 4) or it may have a bearing on a property award in \u000d\u000aconnection with divorce (see Chapter 5). ","Chapter 2: Marriage Page 22\u000d\u000aVoid Marriages \u000d\u000aThe failure to comply with the prerequisites of marriage may render the marriage void or voidable. \u000d\u000aA void marriage is one which is regarded as a nullity; a voidable marriage is one which may be considered \u000d\u000aa nullity but only if a court or similar authority so determines. In some parts of the United States, for \u000d\u000aexample, a marriage in which one of the spouses is underage is considered voidable. The spouse or her \u000d\u000aparents may petition a court to declare the marriage a nullity. A voidable marriage may be ratified, however, \u000d\u000aby the parties\u2019 continuing cohabitation until the condition which rendered the marriage voidable is removed; \u000d\u000athat is, until the underage party attains the legal age for marriage. \u000d\u000aRecognition of Foreign Marriages \u000d\u000aIn general, a marriage which is valid under the law of the State where it is entered into will be \u000d\u000arecognized as valid by another State. The exception to this is that if a marriage is void as a matter of public \u000d\u000apolicy in the second State, it may not be recognized even if it were valid under the laws of the State in \u000d\u000awhich it was entered into. In countries where bigamy is unlawful, for example, polygamous marriages may \u000d\u000abe regarded as null and void. In France, for example, the second and third wives of Muslim immigrants \u000d\u000afrom Northern Africa or the Middle East are not considered the wives of their husbands even though they \u000d\u000awere recognized as legal wives in the State in which they were married. Because polygamy is barred as a \u000d\u000amatter of public policy in France, they are not entitled to the legal protections accorded legal wives under \u000d\u000aFrench law. \u000d\u000a3. Cultural Variations \u000d\u000aThe consent of at least two parties is necessary for a valid marriage, but it need not be the consent \u000d\u000aof the prospective husband and wife. Syria, for example, follows the Muslim law of the Hanafi school, \u000d\u000awhich has been modified to allow a judicial override. That is, under Syrian law, a wali (guardian) cannot \u000d\u000aunfairly block or delay the marriage of a woman who has attained majority. If he does so, the woman can \u000d\u000acomplain to a judge, who can override the wali\u2019s decision and perform the marriage himself. \u000d\u000aIn Cameroon, couples can choose to be married under statutory law or customary law. The latter \u000d\u000apermits polygamous marriages and requires the payment of a bride-price. Since the bride-price is paid to \u000d\u000athe family, represented by the family head, parental consent is implicitly required. Customary law marriages \u000d\u000ajoin the two families as well as the two spouses. \u000d\u000aAn unusual local custom regarding consent may be found on the Indonesian island of Lombok, \u000d\u000awhere parents traditionally arranged their daughters\u2019 marriages. If a lover broke into the daughter\u2019s \u000d\u000abedroom, however, and kidnaped her, the parents would condone their marriage. Although globalization \u000d\u000ahas eroded traditional customs, and arranged marriages are no longer the norm, many couples still carry out \u000d\u000athe charade of kidnaping because it is considered thrilling and romantic. \u000d\u000a4.

National Implementation \u000d\u000aFollowing a regime change in 1991 in Ethiopia, the new government adopted a Charter which \u000d\u000aexplicitly affirmed the rights set out in the Universal Declaration. Ethiopia subsequently ratified the ICCPR, \u000d\u000athe ICESCR, the CRC, and the Women\u2019s Convention. In the new Constitution of 1995, Ethiopia reaffirmed \u000d\u000aits commitment to women\u2019s equality and the rights of children. The Revised Family Code (RFC) of 2000 \u000d\u000awas enacted in order to conform family law to the Constitution. \u000d\u000aUnder the RFC, the age of marriage is set at 18, rather than 15, in accordance with the CRC. The \u000d\u000anew law recognizes three forms of marriage: customary, civil, and religious. There are ongoing tensions \u000d\u000abetween customary and religious norms, on one hand, and the norm of gender equality, on the other. Laws \u000d\u000afrom the 1961 Civil Code establishing the husband as head of the family, a duty of wifely obedience, wifely \u000d\u000aperformance of household duties, and the husband\u2019s right to choose the family residence, guide the wife in \u000d\u000aher conduct, and manage common property (not including the wife\u2019s earnings), have all been repealed. \u000d\u000aThe RFC, in contrast, requires the husband and wife to jointly manage the family, which includes \u000d\u000ajointly choosing the family\u2019s place of residence. In addition, the parties have mutual support obligations \u000d\u000aand they are to cooperate with respect to child rearing and management of family property. The latter, \u000d\u000ahowever, may be modified by contract. \u000d\u000a8. IOs and NGOs\u000d\u000aIOs \u000d\u000aIOs and NGOs have increasingly focused on marriage, exposing the ways in which it has operated to \u000d\u000aeffectively deny the human rights of women and children. In the excerpt below, for example, UNICEF \u000d\u000adescribes the effects of early marriage, that is, marriage below the age of 18. \u000d\u000aFrom UNICEF, Early Marriage Child Spouses (March 2001) \u000d\u000aBirth, marriage and death are the standard trio of key events in most people\u2019s lives. But only one \u2013\u000d\u000amarriage \u2013 is a matter of choice. The right to exercise that choice was recognized as a principle of law even \u000d\u000ain Roman times and has long been established in international human rights instruments. Yet many girls, \u000d\u000aand a smaller number of boys, enter marriage without any chance of exercising their right to choose. \u000d\u000aSome are forced into marriage at a very early age. Others are simply too young to make an informed \u000d\u000adecision about their marriage partner or about the implications of marriage itself. They may have given \u000d\u000awhat passes for \u2018consent\u2019 in the eyes of custom or the law, but in reality, consent to their binding union has \u000d\u000abeen made by others on their behalf. \u000d\u000aThe assumption is that once a girl is married, she has become a woman \u2013 even if she is only 12. \u000d\u000aEqually, where a boy is made to marry, he is now a man and must put away childish things. While the age \u000d\u000aof marriage is generally on the rise, early marriage \u2013 marriage of children and adolescents below the age of \u000d\u000a18 \u2013 is still widely practiced. \u000d\u000aWhile early marriage takes many different forms and has various causes, one issue is paramount. \u000d\u000aWhether it happens to a girl or a boy, early marriage is a violation of human rights. The right to free and \u000d\u000afull consent to a marriage is recognized in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and \u000d\u000ain many subsequent human rights instruments \u2013 consent that cannot be \u2018free and full\u2019 when at least one \u000d\u000apartner is very immature. For both girls and boys, early marriage has profound physical, intellectual, \u000d\u000apsychological and emotional impacts, cutting off educational opportunity and chances of personal growth. ","Chapter 2: Marriage Page 27\u000d\u000aFor girls, in addition, it will almost certainly mean premature pregnancy and childbearing, and is likely to \u000d\u000alead to a lifetime of domestic and sexual subservience over which they have no control. \u000d\u000aYet many societies, primarily in Africa and South Asia, continue to support the idea that \u000d\u000agirls should marry at or soon after puberty. Their spouses are likely to be a few years older than they are, \u000d\u000abut may be more than twice their age. Parents and heads of families make marital choices for daughters and \u000d\u000asons with little regard for the personal implications. Rather, they look upon marriage as a family-building \u000d\u000astrategy, an economic arrangement or a way to protect girls from unwelcome sexual advances. \u000d\u000aNeglect of the Rights Perspective \u000d\u000aSocial reformers in the first part of the 20th century were concerned about early marriage, especially \u000d\u000ain India, and influenced the UDHR and other human rights conventions of the 1950s and 1960s. In the latter \u000d\u000apart of the 20th century, interest centered on the behavioral determinants fueling rapid population growth, \u000d\u000afor obvious reasons. Early marriage extends a woman\u2019s reproductive span, thereby contributing to large \u000d\u000afamily size, especially in the absence of contraception. \u000d\u000aMore recently, advocates of safe motherhood have turned their attention to this issue. Pregnancies \u000d\u000athat occur \u2018too early\u2019 \u2013 when a woman\u2019s body is not fully mature \u2013 constitute a major risk to the survival \u000d\u000aand future health of both mother and child. Concern with the special health needs of adolescents has also \u000d\u000arecently been growing in a world where young people are particularly vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. \u000d\u000aHowever, from a demographic health perspective, early marriage is seen primarily as a contributory \u000d\u000afactor to early child-bearing. And sometimes, even in this context, its role is overlooked: the phrase \u2018teenage \u000d\u000apregnancy\u2019 is typically understood to mean pregnancy outside marriage. Yet far more adolescent or teenage \u000d\u000apregnancies occur within marriage than outside it. \u000d\u000aDuring the past decade, the movement for \u2018Education for All\u2019 has stressed the need to enroll more \u000d\u000agirls in school and to keep them from dropping out before completion. In this context, the custom of early \u000d\u000amarriage is acknowledged as one of the reasons for girls\u2019 exclusion from school, especially in cultural \u000d\u000asettings where girls are raised for a lifetime confined to household occupations and are expected to marry \u000d\u000avery young. Very recently, the situation of children in need of special protection, notably girls vulnerable \u000d\u000ato sexual abuse and HIV/AIDS, suggests that early marriage is being used as a strategy to protect girls from \u000d\u000asexual exposure, or to pass the economic burden for their care to others. Thus, early marriage lingers on as \u000d\u000aa culturally and socially sanctioned practice according to some traditional sets of values and, among some \u000d\u000ahighly stressed populations, it may even be on the rise. \u000d\u000aDespite the efforts of reformers in the early part of the 20th century, early marriage has received \u000d\u000ascant attention from the modern women\u2019s rights and children\u2019s rights movements. There has been virtually \u000d\u000ano attempt to examine the practice as a human rights violation in 24 International Family Law itself. \u000d\u000aChildren and teenagers married at ages well below the legal minimum become statistically invisible as \u000d\u000a\u2018children\u2019. Thus, in the eyes of the law, an adult male who has sex with a girl of 12 or 13 outside marriage \u000d\u000amay be regarded as a criminal, while the same act within marriage is condoned. \u000d\u000aTo date, most studies on the effects of early marriage have focused on premature sex and pregnancy \u000d\u000aand school drop-out. Much work remains to be done, therefore, to analyse the full impact of this practice. \u000d\u000aSanctions Against Early Marriage \u2013 The Legal Context \u000d\u000aIn many countries, early marriage falls into what amounts to a sanctions limbo. It may be prohibited \u000d\u000ain the existing civil or common law, but be widely condoned by customary and religious laws and practice. \u000d\u000aThis is common where marriages typically take place according to customary rites and remain unregistered. \u000d\u000aThe situation is further complicated in countries where legislation was introduced by the colonizing \u000d\u000apower on the understanding that many customary practices would continue even if they were inconsistent \u000d\u000awith new laws. Some were even codified to make them legal. In Benin, for example, Article 68 of the 1931 \u000d\u000a\u2018Coutumier du Dahomey\u2019 regulating customary marriage states that: \u2018A marriage is not settled by the \u000d\u000ainterested parties, but by their father, or in his absence by his older brother, or failing him, by the head of ","Chapter 2: Marriage Page 28\u000d\u000athe family\u2019. In Suriname, the legal minimum age of marriage is 15 according to the Civil Code; but under \u000d\u000athe Asian Marriage Act, which codifies practice for a particular group, the minimum age for girls is 13. \u000d\u000aAlthough most countries have laws that regulate marriage, both in terms of minimum age and \u000d\u000aconsent, these laws may not be applied and few prosecutions are ever brought against lawbreakers \u2013 parents, \u000d\u000aofficiators or spouses. Some laws do not prescribe sanctions; the only outcome of a case would be to declare \u000d\u000athe marriage invalid, leaving the wife without legal protection. Moreover, such laws usually do not apply \u000d\u000ato customary marriages. \u000d\u000aIn some countries, the legal minimum age of marriage set for boys and girls is clearly aspirational. \u000d\u000aThus, the minimum age in two countries with a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS \u2013 Uganda, where 50 per cent \u000d\u000aof girls aged 15-19 are married, and Zambia, where the figure is 27 percent \u2013 has been set at 21 for both \u000d\u000amales and females. \u000d\u000aIn most cases where a minimum age is set, it is 18 or above for both males and females. In 15 \u000d\u000acountries, it is 16. A number of countries nonetheless allow marriages to take place at much younger ages \u000d\u000awith parental consent. \u000d\u000aIn cases where there is a discrepancy between the minimum age of marriage for boys and girls, it \u000d\u000ais consistently lower for girls. However, at least 20 countries either do not have legislation to regulate \u000d\u000amarriage, or do not set any minimum age for either girls or boys. \u000d\u000aThe situation is exacerbated by the fact that birth registration is so irregular that age at marriage \u000d\u000amay not be known. In addition, many marriages go unregistered; if there are problems in the marriage, the \u000d\u000awife has no means of legal redress. \u000d\u000aThus, the use of law as a means of regulating early marriage is in no way sufficient. This does not \u000d\u000amean that legal reform should not be sought. The Indian Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929 stemmed from \u000d\u000aa campaign that helped reposition women, family life, and childbearing within modern India. While the Act \u000d\u000adid not declare child marriages invalid, it helped pave the way for change. In 1978 it was strengthened to \u000d\u000ainhibit marriage of girls until the age of 18 and boys until age 21. However, the number of prosecutions \u000d\u000aunder the Act did not exceed 89 in any year between 1994 and 1998. Some governments have taken \u000d\u000aMarriage 25 steps to unify their customary law and civil or common law, or have passed legislation designed \u000d\u000ato protect those in customary marriages: South Africa\u2019s Recognition of Customary Marriages Act of 1998 \u000d\u000asets 18 as the minimum age for such unions and requires their registration. \u000d\u000aIn keeping with the spirit of the CRC, an increasing number of laws fix the minimum age at 18 \u000d\u000ayears \u2013 the standard also set by the 1990 African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child and \u000d\u000asuggested by the CEDAW Committee in its general recommendation 21 and by the UN Special Rapporteur \u000d\u000aon Violence against Women. This standard responds to the growing consensus that the period of \u000d\u000aadolescence needs special support and protection. \u000d\u000aThe Inter-African Committee (IAC) on Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and \u000d\u000aChildren states that early marriage is: \u2018Any marriage carried out below the age of 18 years, before the girl \u000d\u000ais physically, physiologically, and psychologically ready to shoulder the responsibilities of marriage and \u000d\u000achildbearing.\u2019 The Forum on Marriage echoes this position. \u000d\u000aIn their observations on States Parties\u2019 reports, the CEDAW and CRC Committees have both \u000d\u000aconsistently recommended that states adopt higher minimum ages of marriage and ensure that these are the \u000d\u000asame for boys and girls. The CRC Committee also takes the view that, in cases where girls are considered \u000d\u000aadults before the law upon marriage, they would be deprived of the comprehensive protection of the CRC. \u000d\u000aConsent: Law and Practice \u000d\u000aThe second issue at the heart of a rights approach to early marriage is that of consent. The picture \u000d\u000ais similar to that concerning minimum age: in the vast majority of countries the law grants women the right \u000d\u000ato consent. Only in Cameroon, Jordan, Morocco, Uganda and Yemen are women specifically not granted \u000d\u000aby law the right to \u2018full, free and informed consent\u2019 to their marriage. But in a large number of countries, \u000d\u000athese legal provisions are merely symbolic. ","Chapter 2: Marriage Page 29\u000d\u000aThe more important practical issue is, therefore, whether or not the idea of consent is socially rated. \u000d\u000aDifficult questions arise around the age a child should be before he or she can \u2018consent\u2019 as a mature, \u000d\u000acognisant and independent being to sexual relations or marriage, but where no clear consent has been given \u000d\u000aby one or other partner, the marriage is clearly forced. \u000d\u000aIn the case of marriages under the age of 10, consent \u2013 other than to dress up and play a game \u2013 is \u000d\u000anot a consideration. Toddlers married at Akha Teej ceremonies in Rajasthan cannot \u2018consent\u2019. Nor is \u000d\u000aconsent given in the cases of young girls from very poor homes in the Indian city of Hyderabad, Andhra \u000d\u000aPradesh, sold as wives to rich men in the Middle East. In Gojam, Ethiopia, marriages may be imposed from \u000d\u000abirth, with the girl sent to her future husband\u2019s home at around the age of seven to begin her integration \u000d\u000ainto her marriage family. Here again, consent by the girl does not enter the picture. Similarly, in marriages \u000d\u000aat or around puberty \u2013 from roughly ages 10 to 14 \u2013 \u2018consent\u2019 cannot be said to have been given since, at \u000d\u000asuch an early age, a child cannot be expected to understand the implications of accepting a lifetime partner. \u000d\u000aThe question of marital consent becomes more difficult at age 15 or 16, by which stage a girl may \u000d\u000ahave reached the legal age of sexual consent. In the CEDAW Committee\u2019s recommendation that the \u000d\u000aminimum age for marriage of both men and women should be 18, it commented that, \u2018When men and \u000d\u000awomen marry, they assume important responsibilities. Consequently, marriage should not be permitted \u000d\u000abefore they have attained full maturity and 26 International Family Law capacity to act.\u2019 The Committee \u000d\u000aalso observed that, \u2018Some countries provide for different ages for marriage for men and women. As such \u000d\u000aprovisions assume incorrectly that women have a different rate of intellectual development from men, or \u000d\u000athat their stage of physical and intellectual development at marriage is immaterial, these provisions should \u000d\u000abe abolished.\u2019 \u000d\u000aIt could be argued that even older children cannot be said to give informed consent to such a \u000d\u000apotentially damaging practice as early marriage. Beyond the issues of maturity and non discrimination, any \u000d\u000aargument for a child\u2019s ability to consent to marriage is further undermined by the risk that marriage \u000d\u000arepresents to his or her well-being. Many international bodies consider early marriage to be one of the \u000d\u000a\u2018traditional practices prejudicial to the health of children\u2019 cited in article 24(3) of the Convention on the \u000d\u000aRights of the Child. Indeed, one of the key messages contained in this Digest is that both the physical and \u000d\u000apsychological impacts of early marriage may have serious implications for the well-being of those married. \u000d\u000aFurthermore, while in many countries a girl or boy may have reached the legal age of sexual consent \u000d\u000aat the age of 15 or 16, this should not be taken to mean that they are ready to enter marriage. A lack of \u000d\u000alegislative clarity over the different implications of consent to sexual activity and consent to marriage can \u000d\u000aresult in strange anomalies. In Maryland, USA, the state law defines statutory rape as sex with a child \u000d\u000ayounger than 14 by someone four or more years older. However, another law allows children under 16 \u000d\u000a(with no minimum) to marry with proof of pregnancy and parental permission, and this provision is \u000d\u000asometimes used \u2013 in one notorious case to allow a 29-year-old man to marry a 13-year-old girl. \u000d\u000aIn 1997, the Committee on the Rights of the Child protested a similar situation in Algeria. Here, as \u000d\u000ain other countries such as Chad, Costa Rica, Lebanon, Libya, Romania and Uruguay, the law allows a \u000d\u000aperpetrator of rape, including statutory rape of a minor, to be excused of his crime if he marries his victim; \u000d\u000aa judge simply legitimizes the union. This has also happened in California in cases of under-age pregnancies \u000d\u000awhere the man is willing to \u2018stand by\u2019 the girl. In effect, the state welfare agency supports what is seen as \u000d\u000aa viable partnership as an alternative to costly state care for mother and child. \u000d\u000aIn a number of countries, it takes only the parents\u2019 consent to override the legal age of marriage \u2013\u000d\u000aa judge is not required. In Colombia, the legal age is 18, but with parents\u2019 permission girls of 12 and boys \u000d\u000aof 14 can be married. In the Dominican Republic there is no minimum age in exceptional circumstances \u000d\u000aand with parental consent. \u000d\u000aThe UK Home Office Report into forced marriages of British girls of South Asian parentage \u000d\u000adistinguishes between \u2018forced\u2019 and \u2018arranged\u2019 marriages. In arranged marriages, the initiative is taken by \u000d\u000athe parents of the couple, but consent is required from both partners and either has the right to withdraw. \u000d\u000aHowever, the pressures from parents may be very high, and the younger the bride or groom the less real \u000d\u000achance there is to exercise this right. Both types of marriage indicate the degree to which many societies \u000d\u000aview marriage as a family affair in which the views of people other than the couple are given priority. ","Chapter 2: Marriage Page 30\u000d\u000aParents\u2019 views will override children\u2019s, and men\u2019s will override women\u2019s \u2013 even taking precedence over \u000d\u000athe law. \u000d\u000aCases of runaway brides highlight the issue of consent \u2013 or lack of it. In Pakistan, the Commission \u000d\u000aon the Status of Women reported in 1989: \u2018Men are constantly fighting to retrieve their women because \u000d\u000athey have run away.\u2019 There are reports of young wives being locked up by their husbands in India, and in \u000d\u000aZimbabwe it is often forbidden for a young bride to visit her own family until she goes there to give birth \u000d\u000ato her first child. In one tragic case in Nigeria, a 12-year-old girl unhappy with her new husband ran away \u000d\u000aso often that he cut off her legs to prevent her absconding. She subsequently died. \u000d\u000aThe CRC Committee has focused on laws and customs in its observations to a number of countries. \u000d\u000aIts most common complaints are low minimum age for girls and disparate \u2013 therefore discriminatory \u2013\u000d\u000amarriage ages for girls and boys. \u000d\u000a* * *\u000d\u000aPersonal status laws in Syria and Morocco, among other countries, continued to curtail women\u2019s \u000d\u000arights entering into marriage, during marriage, and the dissolution of marriage. In Syria, the minimum age \u000d\u000afor marriage was eighteen for boys and seventeen for girls. If a woman over the age of seventeen married \u000d\u000awithout the consent of a male guardian, the guardian could demand the annulment of the marriage if the \u000d\u000ahusband was not of the same social standing as the wife, and as long as the wife were not pregnant. Further, \u000d\u000aa Muslim Syrian woman could not marry a non-Muslim, while a Muslim man had absolute freedom to \u000d\u000achoose a spouse. Syrian law also assigned different rights and responsibilities for women and men during \u000d\u000amarriage. A wife\u2019s \u2018disobedience\u2019 could lead to forfeiture of her husband\u2019s responsibility to provide \u000d\u000asupport. A man could legally have up to four wives simultaneously, while a woman could have only one \u000d\u000ahusband.\u000d\u000a9. A Possible Approach to the Problem \u000d\u000aAs suggested in the Overview, the major question here is whether Ami\u2019s marriage to Ratna was \u000d\u000avalid. If it was, it was a bar to his marriage to Julia and Ami is in fact a bigamist. Although India recognizes \u000d\u000amultiple forms of marriage, it seems unlikely that the early marriage to Ratna would be recognized for a \u000d\u000arange of practical as well as doctrinal reasons. \u000d\u000aFirst, the Child Marriage Restraint Act of 1929 explicitly sets minimum ages for marriages. \u000d\u000aAlthough the Act does not invalidate the resulting marriage, it is evidence of the public policy against it. \u000d\u000aThe Compulsory Registration of Marriage Act of 2002 would obviously not cover Ami and Ratna\u2019s \u000d\u000amarriage sixteen years earlier, but it suggests the ongoing tension between culture and legal norms in \u000d\u000aRajasthan, where the marriage took place, and where UNICEF found that half of the population had married \u000d\u000abefore the age of 15. \u000d\u000aInformation about Ratna\u2019s current situation would be helpful. If she is married, for example, she \u000d\u000amay agree to an annulment. Underage marriages are voidable, and there has been no ratification (by \u000d\u000acontinuing cohabitation) here. On the other hand, if Ratna hopes for British citizenship (or support from \u000d\u000aAmi), she may argue that the marriage was valid. Further research would be necessary to determine whether \u000d\u000athe U.K. would refuse to recognize the marriage as void as a matter of public policy. \u000d\u000aIf the U.K. is a party to the Convention on Celebration it is required to recognize foreign marriages \u000d\u000aunless \u2018manifestly incompatible\u2019 with the law of the State of celebration (India). While the Convention \u000d\u000aexplicitly exempts underage marriage, the exemption itself may be avoided by the \u2018necessary dispensation.\u2019 \u000d\u000aIn the U.S., this would refer to the consent of the parents of an underage spouse. While further research \u000d\u000awould be necessary to ascertain the substance of \u2018necessary dispensation\u2019 under other States\u2019 law, an \u000d\u000ainterpretation of this phrase that validated a marriage entered into without the actual consent of the parties \u000d\u000a(Ami and Ratna) would arguably vitiate the Convention. \u000d\u000aThe excerpts from the human rights conventions set out in Section 5 [of this book] show that the \u000d\u000a\u2018free consent\u2019 of the parties to a marriage (as opposed to their families) is a widely recognized human rights ","Chapter 2: Marriage Page 31\u000d\u000anorm. The rights of the girl child are a particular concern. The regional conventions confirm the \u000d\u000ageographical scope of the norm, with some significant variations. Under the European Convention, for \u000d\u000aexample, the privacy protections of Article 8 would probably not bar a claim against Ami by Ratna. The \u000d\u000aprotection of \u2018honor\u2019 and family privacy under Article V of the American Convention, in contrast, might \u000d\u000adeter such threats by an outsider against the family. \u000d\u000aSection 7 highlights the political significance of the laws against child marriage in the developing \u000d\u000aworld. The new government in Ethiopia made a dramatic break with the past, affirming its commitment to \u000d\u000ahuman rights. In India, on the other hand, efforts to restrict child marriage have long been linked to \u000d\u000acolonialism. While the national government has ratified many human rights instruments, local governments \u000d\u000amay resist \u2018western\u2019 restriction as a matter of cultural pride.

For example, the May 17 vote in Taiwan\u2019s Legislative Yuan (the \u000d\u000aofficial name of the nation\u2019s unicameral parliament) was prompted by a 2017 decision by the \u000d\u000acountry\u2019s Constitutional Court, which struck down a law defining marriage as a union between a man \u000d\u000aand woman. Likewise, Austria\u2019s legalization of gay marriage at the beginning of 2019 came after a \u000d\u000a2017 ruling by the country\u2019s Constitutional Court. In the United States, the Supreme Court legalized \u000d\u000agay marriage nationwide in a 2015 ruling.\u000d\u000aAlphabetical List of countries that allow same-sex marriage: https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/factsheet/gay-marriage-around-the-world/","Chapter 2: Marriage Page 33\u000d\u000aSECTION 2.4: MAIL ORDER BRIDES\u000d\u000aMail Order Brides and the International Marriage Broker Regulation Act of 2005:\u000d\u000aThe International Marriage Broker Regulation Act of 2005 (Subtitle D of Title VIII (Sec.831-834) of United \u000d\u000aStates Public Law 109-162), or IMBRA, is a United States federal statute that requires background checks for \u000d\u000aall marriage visa sponsors and limits serial visa applications. Additionally, the law requires background checks \u000d\u000afor US citizens using marriage brokerage services focused primarily on providing dating services between US \u000d\u000acitizens or residents and foreign nationals for a fee. The impetus for its introduction were two cases (including \u000d\u000athe Susanna Blackwell case in 1995 and the Anastasia King case in 2000) in which foreign women had been \u000d\u000aabused and eventually murdered by men who had used a K-1 fianc\u00e9e visa issued by the US State Department to \u000d\u000abring them to the United States. In the King case, the husband had physically abused a previous foreign bride \u000d\u000abefore murdering Anastasia. King had met Anastasia through his own advertisement in a Moscow newspaper \u000d\u000a(not through an international marriage broker). In the Blackwell case, the husband had a clean record, therefore \u000d\u000aIMBRA would not have prevented her murder. It was intended to stop abuse of mail order brides by prospective \u000d\u000ahusbands with criminal histories. IMBRA met with opposition from international dating companies when it was \u000d\u000afirst introduced. Some industry executives claim the industry has grown to appreciate it to ensure the safety of \u000d\u000aits female clients.\u000d\u000aViolence against mail-order brides in the United States:\u000d\u000a\u25cf In September 2003, 26-year-old Ukrainian engineer and mail-order bride Alla Barney bled to death on the \u000d\u000afloor of her car after her American husband Lester Barney, 58, slashed her throat in front of the couple\u2019s \u000d\u000afour-year-old son Daniel. Lester fled with Daniel from the scene in the parking lot of the boy\u2019s day-care \u000d\u000acenter; after an Amber Alert was triggered, he turned Daniel over to a friend and was taken into custody by \u000d\u000apolice. Alla had been granted a restraining order against Lester a few months before, and had been given \u000d\u000atemporary custody of Daniel. \u000d\u000a\u25cf Anastasia King, a young woman from Kyrgyzstan, was found strangled and buried in a shallow grave in \u000d\u000aWashington State in December 2000. At age 18, Anastasia received an email from a 38-year-old Seattle \u000d\u000aman named Indle King, from a mail-order bride website. He flew to her country, and they were married\u000d\u000asoon after. Two years later, after considerable strife, Indle wanted another bride. He was allegedly unwilling \u000d\u000ato pay for a divorce, so he ordered a tenant in their Washington home to kill Anastasia. Weighing nearly \u000d\u000a300 pounds, her husband pinned Anastasia down while the tenant strangled her with a necktie. Both were \u000d\u000aconvicted of murder. King\u2019s previous wife, whom he had also met through an IMB, had a domestic\u000d\u000aviolence protection order issued against him, and left him because he was abusive.\u000d\u000a\u25cf Nina Reiser was a Russian-born and -trained obstetrician and gynecologist. She was murdered by her \u000d\u000ahusband Hans Reiser, a businessman and computer programmer whom she met after placing an ad in a mailorder bride catalog. She had a restraining order against him during their divorce proceedings. Nina was \u000d\u000areported missing on September 5, 2006. That month Hans was detained by Oakland police due to suspicions \u000d\u000asurrounding the disappearance of his wife, and was later arrested for suspected murder. On April 28, 2008 \u000d\u000aHans Reiser was found guilty of first-degree murder, and was sentenced to 15 years to life in prison. On \u000d\u000aJuly 7, 2008, Hans led Oakland police to his wife's remains with an agreement to be charged with seconddegree murder instead.\u000d\u000aLegal matters for mail-order brides in the United States:\u000d\u000aMarriage agencies are legal in almost all countries. On January 6, 2006, the United States Congress enacted H.R. \u000d\u000a3402: Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005.

If you don't understand the laws of your state -- or even if you think you do --\u000d\u000ayou and your partner should use separate attorneys to make a written legal agreement, and follow through \u000d\u000aon the titling of your property.\u000d\u000aThis is not a question of morals or social trends. According to the 2011 Census Bureau report there were \u000d\u000aan estimated 7.6 million opposite-sex cohabiting couples and nearly a million more same-sex couples \u000d\u000aliving together. These couples share rent, homes, mortgages, expenses and children.\u000d\u000aBut while they may choose to live outside the conventional bounds of marriage, they don't live outside the \u000d\u000aconventional bounds of property law, which differs state by state.\u000d\u000aThe Illinois Supreme Court recently ruled that a couple who had lived together for many years, had three \u000d\u000achildren together and were each professionals were not subject to the \"equitable property distribution\" \u000d\u000alaws that apply to married couples in the state. So, despite the fact that the lower-paid partner sacrificed \u000d\u000aher income to stay home part time with the children, she was not entitled to compensation or equitable \u000d\u000arights in property when the couple later split up. \u000d\u000aThe kicker to this story: The lower-paid partner was a judge! She obviously didn't know this aspect of the \u000d\u000alaw in her home state.\u000d\u000aThe case has raised issues in Illinois, which recently modernized most of its marital law. But the \u000d\u000amodernization failed to address this issue of rights of unmarried couples, despite societal changes.\u000d\u000aThe lesson here: Know the laws of your state regarding the rights of cohabiting couples and common-law \u000d\u000amarriages. While some states, such as California, have laws respecting the rights of \"domestic partners,\" \u000d\u000aother states still prohibit cohabitation. Michigan and Mississippi have those prohibitions, while Florida \u000d\u000astruck down its prohibition against cohabitation only a year ago. And federal tax laws do not respect \u000d\u000amarital deductions and other tax benefits if a state law prohibits cohabitation.\u000d\u000aAbout four years ago, I co-authored a book called \"The New Love Deal: Everything You Must Know \u000d\u000aBefore Marrying, Moving In or Moving On.\" My co-authors are noted Chicago divorce attorney Gemma \u000d\u000aAllen and 20-year divorce court judge (and now an acclaimed mediator) Michele Lowrance.\u000d\u000aIn that book, we strongly recommended creating written agreements before moving in together. And we \u000d\u000aclearly stated that each party should be represented separately by an attorney familiar with state marital \u000d\u000aand property laws. We believe agreements represent love and concern, not a lack of trust.\u000d\u000aAfter the Illinois case made headlines recently, I asked Gemma Allen for her latest advice. Here's what \u000d\u000ashe had to offer:\u000d\u000a--First of all, see a local attorney with expertise in this area, no matter where you live -- as well as if and \u000d\u000awhen you move.","Chapter 3: Cohabitation and Other Unions Page 39\u000d\u000a--Even if a state and its statutes formally recognize property or other rights to cohabitants, still the only \u000d\u000asafe way to proceed is with a written agreement setting forth the precise terms of the arrangement.\u000d\u000a--The best and safest way to proceed in each and every instance is to use joint titling on real estate and \u000d\u000abank accounts and boats and planes and art and anything else that allows or follows a titling concept.\u000d\u000a--Trusts are also an effective way cohabitants can provide for each other. But to the extent the trusts are \u000d\u000arevocable, of course, the partners again become vulnerable.\u000d\u000aThere are a few more things to remember. When you make your written agreement, do not mention the \u000d\u000asexual relationship; instead focus on practical and contractual items. Many states do not recognize \u000d\u000aagreements based on \"sexual favors.\" (I'm just reporting the facts here!)\u000d\u000aAlso, even if you work for a company that offers benefits to domestic partners, that does not mean that \u000d\u000athe property laws of your state also recognize them. So don't be lulled into complacency because some \u000d\u000aaspects of your relationship are publicly recognized.\u000d\u000aGood attorneys will create documents that cover many tricky situations for unmarried couples. For \u000d\u000ainstance, non-spouses are not automatically able to make health-care decisions -- or even hospital visits --\u000d\u000aunless they hold a health care power of attorney. And a living will can empower end-of-life directives that \u000d\u000aavoid problems.\u000d\u000aWhile non-spouses can be beneficiaries of retirement plans, some attractive withdrawal options are lost if \u000d\u000athe couple is not legally married. And for higher net worth couples, some estate tax benefits are lost if the \u000d\u000acouple is not married. These are all things to consider in your agreement.\u000d\u000aCohabitation may seem convenient and comfortable, but it has its costs. And that's The Savage Truth.","Chapter 3: Cohabitation and Other Unions Page 40\u000d\u000aIncreasing Cohabitation is Destabalizing the Canadian Family\u000d\u000aBy Andrea Mrozek and Peter Jon Mitchell\u000d\u000ahttps://ifstudies.org/blog/increasing-cohabitation-is-destabilizing-the-canadian-family\u000d\u000aAugust 23, 2017\u000d\u000aIn early August 2017, Statistics Canada released new Canadian census data about families. We parsed that \u000d\u000adata in a report placing Canadian statistics in historical and international comparison. In some ways, the \u000d\u000aCanadian family is quite stable. Yet in one critical way\u2014our rising cohabitation rates, particularly in \u000d\u000aQuebec\u2014it\u2019s not. As readers of this blog know well, cohabitation is a markedly less stable family \u000d\u000aform when contrasted with marriage. Therefore, we can say that on the whole, Canadian family stats are \u000d\u000aheading in the wrong direction.\u000d\u000aFirst, some generalities: Seven in 10 Canadian children are being raised by their own parents, whether \u000d\u000abiological or adoptive, and lone parenting has stabilized. About 19% of children lived with a lone parent in \u000d\u000athe last census in 2011, and this remains the same in 2016. Given that children raised by their own parents \u000d\u000ais a social good, these stats are slightly better than those in the United States.\u000d\u000aThe marriage rate in Canada declined between 2001 and 2016. As seen in the figure below, in 2001, married \u000d\u000acouples made up 84% of all couples; by 2016, married couples made up 78.7% of all couples. With this \u000d\u000acensus, single-person households outnumber couples with children for the first time, representing a \u000d\u000asignificant demographic shift.","Chapter 3: Cohabitation and Other Unions Page 41\u000d\u000aCohabitation in Canada\u000d\u000aHowever, cohabitation continues a long upward trend in Canada. In 2001, 16.4% of all couples were \u000d\u000aliving together, increasing to 21% by 2016, as the figure below indicates.\u000d\u000aThe numbers are starker when looking at Quebec, Canada\u2019s only francophone province. In 2001, a quarter \u000d\u000a(25.2%) of all families there were living together. In 2011, this jumped to 31.5% percent, a 25% increase.\u000d\u000aQuebec has one of the highest rates of cohabitation in the world. The reasons for this are varied, but a \u000d\u000asignificant factor is the legacy of the Quiet Revolution, a cultural shift away from the province\u2019s Roman \u000d\u000aCatholic roots, starting in the 1960s. During this time, Quebeckers gave up on norms associated with \u000d\u000aCatholicism, including marriage. As a result, many social statistics differ dramatically from the rest of \u000d\u000aCanada in Quebec.\u000d\u000aResearch shows a normalization of cohabitation in Quebec. However, marriage still remains a more stable \u000d\u000afamily form, even there. Statistics Canada examined the portion of children living in lone-parent, stepparent, and non-parent families. They observed the portion of children in these families at age four and \u000d\u000aunder and children ages 10 to 14. Quebec had the largest increase in children moving from an intact family \u000d\u000ainto a lone parent, step-parent, or non-parent home. The gap between the younger and older cohorts in \u000d\u000aQuebec was 19.2 percentage points. The Canadian national average gap was only 12.7 percentage points. \u000d\u000aThe agency speculates that this \u201cmay be related to higher instability among common-law unions, which are \u000d\u000amore popular in Quebec than elsewhere in Canada (except in Nunavut), rather than the result of more \u000d\u000achildren born to lone parents.\u201d\u000d\u000aIn spite of recognizing that cohabitation leads to higher instability, it recently became a more difficult to \u000d\u000aget the numbers of those marrying versus those living together in Canada. Statistics Canada began tracking \u000d\u000acohabitation in the 1981 census, yet in reporting the 2016 findings, the national statistical agency combined \u000d\u000acohabiting and married couples for many categories. In some cases, the agency chose to report on intact \u000d\u000afamilies rather than noting the marital status of those unions. For the first time in decades, Statistics Canada \u000d\u000achose not to report the percentage of Census families that are married couples. As a result, drawing \u000d\u000ahistorical and international comparatives are more difficult.\u000d\u000aComparatively, the United States has lower rates of cohabitation than Canada. In 2011, for example, 11.3% \u000d\u000aof US families were cohabiting families, compared to 16.7% of Canadian families (see figure below).","Chapter 3: Cohabitation and Other Unions Page 42\u000d\u000aOn the other hand, rates of non-marital childbearing are much higher in the US. In 2011, 40.7% of \u000d\u000achildren in the U.S. were born outside of marriage, compared to 30.2% in Canada.\u000d\u000aReviving a Marriage Culture\u000d\u000aAll told, the western world is witnessing family changes that bear watching closely. Given the historical \u000d\u000aties and friendly relationship between the United States and Canada, it\u2019s worth noting the direction of your \u000d\u000aneighbors to the north. The institution of marriage needs reviving both north and south of the border. This \u000d\u000ais one of our key recommendations\u2014and as any scholar of marriage will attest\u2014it is more easily said than \u000d\u000adone.","Chapter 3: Cohabitation and Other Unions Page 43\u000d\u000aThe Pacte Civil de Solidarit\u00e9\u000d\u000aInformation on the alternative to marriage in France, PACS, a civil union which gives couples many \u000d\u000aof the same legal rights of a traditionally married couple.

It gives rights \u000d\u000ato both partners particularly in regard to \"mutual and material\" assistance, for example in the event of \u000d\u000aunemployment or illness.\u000d\u000aEssentially it is a contract made between two people (never more) of either sex. Both partners must be \u000d\u000aaged 18 or over and must have a common place of residence (although not necessarily live together). \u000d\u000aFrench nationality is not required by parties signing a pact, but a foreigner must be legally resident in \u000d\u000aFrance.

Many are lovers not quite ready for \u000d\u000aold-fashioned matrimony.\u000d\u000aWhatever their reasons, and they vary \u000d\u000awidely, French couples are increasingly \u000d\u000ashunning traditional marriages and opting \u000d\u000ainstead for civil unions, to the point that there \u000d\u000aare now two civil unions for every three \u000d\u000amarriages.\u000d\u000aWhen France created its system of civil \u000d\u000aunions in 1999, it was heralded as a \u000d\u000arevolution in gay rights, a relationship almost \u000d\u000alike marriage, but not quite. No one, though, \u000d\u000aanticipated how many couples would make \u000d\u000ause of the new law. Nor was it predicted that \u000d\u000aby 2009, the overwhelming majority of civil \u000d\u000aunions would be between straight couples.\u000d\u000aIt remains unclear whether the idea of a civil \u000d\u000aunion, called a pacte civil de solidarit\u00e9, or \u000d\u000aPACS, has responded to a shift in social \u000d\u000aattitudes or caused one. But it has proved \u000d\u000aremarkably well suited to France and its \u000d\u000aparticularities about marriage, divorce, \u000d\u000areligion and taxes \u2014 and it can be dissolved \u000d\u000awith just a registered letter.\u000d\u000a\u201cWe\u2019re the generation of divorced parents,\u201d \u000d\u000aexplained Maud Hugot, 32, an aide at the \u000d\u000aHealth Ministry who signed a PACS with her \u000d\u000agirlfriend, Nathalie Mondot, 33, this year. \u000d\u000aExpressing a view that researchers say is \u000d\u000abecoming commonplace among same-sex \u000d\u000acouples and heterosexuals alike, she added, \u000d\u000a\u201cThe notion of eternal marriage has grown \u000d\u000aobsolete.\u201d\u000d\u000aFrance recognizes only \u201ccitizens,\u201d and the \u000d\u000acountry\u2019s legal principles hold that special \u000d\u000arights should not be accorded to particular \u000d\u000agroups or ethnicities. So civil unions, which \u000d\u000aconfer most of the tax benefits and legal \u000d\u000aprotections of marriage, were made available \u000d\u000ato everyone. (Marriage, on the other hand, \u000d\u000aremains restricted to heterosexuals.) But the \u000d\u000aattractiveness of civil unions to heterosexual \u000d\u000acouples was evident from the start. In 2000, \u000d\u000ajust one year after the passage of the law, \u000d\u000amore than 75 percent of civil unions were \u000d\u000asigned between heterosexual couples. That \u000d\u000atrend has only strengthened since then: of the \u000d\u000a173,045 civil unions signed in 2009, 95 \u000d\u000apercent were between heterosexual couples.\u000d\u000a\u201cIt\u2019s becoming more and more \u000d\u000acommonplace,\u201d said Laura Anicet, 24, a \u000d\u000astudent who signed a PACS last month with \u000d\u000aher 29-year-old boyfriend, Cyril Reich. \u201cFor \u000d\u000ame, before, the PACS was for homosexual \u000d\u000acouples.\u201d\u000d\u000aAs with traditional marriages, civil unions \u000d\u000aallow couples to file joint tax returns, exempt \u000d\u000aspouses from inheritance taxes, permit \u000d\u000apartners to share insurance policies, ease \u000d\u000aaccess to residency permits for foreigners \u000d\u000aand make partners responsible for each \u000d\u000aother\u2019s debts. Concluding a civil union \u000d\u000arequires little more than a single appearance \u000d\u000abefore a judicial official, and ending one is \u000d\u000aeven easier.\u000d\u000aIt long ago became common here to speak of \u000d\u000a\u201cgetting PACSed\u201d (se pacser, in French). \u000d\u000aMore recently, wedding fairs have been \u000d\u000arenamed to include the PACS, department \u000d\u000astores now offer PACS gift registries and\u000d\u000atravel agencies offer PACS honeymoon \u000d\u000apackages.","Chapter 3: Cohabitation and Other Unions Page 45\u000d\u000aEven the Roman Catholic Church, which\u000d\u000ainitially condemned the partnerships as a \u000d\u000athreat to the institution of marriage, has \u000d\u000arelented; the National Confederation of \u000d\u000aCatholic Family Associations now says civil \u000d\u000aunions do not pose \u201ca real threat.\u201d\u000d\u000aWhile the partnerships have exploded in \u000d\u000apopularity, marriage numbers \u000d\u000ahave continued a long decline in France, as \u000d\u000aacross Europe.

All it contains is the \u000d\u000aissues that you agree upon regarding specific \u000d\u000atopics. These agreements have to do with your \u000d\u000apersonal situation and background. If one or \u000d\u000aboth of you does not have Dutch nationality, it \u000d\u000ais best to seek advice before entering into this \u000d\u000atype of agreement as, generally speaking, \u000d\u000aDutch law applies to a cohabitation agreement \u000d\u000adrawn up in the Netherlands and you want to \u000d\u000amake sure that it is not in conflict with (one of) \u000d\u000ayour national law(s). What all can be arranged \u000d\u000ain a cohabitation agreement drawn up by a civil \u000d\u000alaw notary? \u000d\u000aJoint Expenses: You can agree on how much \u000d\u000aeach of you will contribute to joint expenses. \u000d\u000aThis is usually determined in proportion to the \u000d\u000arespective incomes. Consequently, if one of \u000d\u000ayou generates no income at all, the other bears \u000d\u000aall the expenses. You can also agree on what \u000d\u000aexactly constitutes \u2018joint expenses\u2019. For \u000d\u000ainstance, general household expenses, rent, \u000d\u000ajoint vacations and insurances.

Who will get what? Who gets to \u000d\u000astay in the house? What happens to the pets? \u000d\u000aBy arranging these matters in the cohabitation \u000d\u000aagreement you avoid having to go to court once \u000d\u000ayou separate. \u000d\u000aPension: Many pension funds require a \u000d\u000acohabitation agreement drawn up by a civil law \u000d\u000anotary in order to register the partner for the \u000d\u000asurviving partner pension. \u000d\u000aChildren: If you have children, one of you \u000d\u000amight decide to work less. - is can be \u000d\u000acompensated for by including an income \u000d\u000aand/or alimony clause for this partner.

Since at the time of his \u201cmarriage\u201d to the complainant he was married to his living wife, his \u000d\u000a\u201cmarriage\u201d to her was absolutely void as far as New York was concerned even were it legally consummated in \u000d\u000aNigeria.\u000d\u000aA New York court refused to order that a new marriage license be issued to an Indian man whose preexisting \u000d\u000aHindu marriage in India had not been dissolved. Application of Sood, 208 Misc. 819 (N.Y. 1955). He claimed \u000d\u000athat the marriage was void because Hindu marriage permitted polygamy. The court held that since the marriage \u000d\u000awas only potentially bigamous, and neither spouse had taken a second husband or wife, it must be recognized as \u000d\u000avalid, as long as it was valid under the law of India, the place where it was contracted.\u000d\u000aIn another case concerning Nigerian polygamous marriages, a woman asked for divorce and equitable \u000d\u000adistribution from her purported husband, a Nigerian tribal chief and international entrepreneur worth billions of \u000d\u000adollars. Uboh-Abiola v. Abiola, 6/12/1992 N.Y.L.J. 22, col. 1 (Sup. Ct. N.Y. County 1992). She asserted that \u000d\u000ashe was married in Nigeria and was one of 26 wives to whom the defendant was wed. She stated that the parties \u000d\u000ahad three children together and that defendant had thus far sired a total of 79 children. The court dismissed her \u000d\u000aclaim on the grounds of public policy, since she was not the first wife, although she was awarded child support.\u000d\u000aOne case in which a polygamous marriage was upheld was that of an Indian man who had entered into a \u000d\u000apolygamous marriage while living in India, but had left his wives behind when he had immigrated to the United \u000d\u000aStates. In re Dalip Singh Bir's Estate, 188 P.2d 499 (N.Y. Ct. App. 1948). After he died intestate, his wives \u000d\u000apetitioned the California court for their inheritance jointly. The court ruled that it was not against public policy \u000d\u000ato allow both wives to inherit. The critical distinction in this case was that the polygamy never occurred in the \u000d\u000aU.S.; the wives remained overseas. A New York court ruled similarly in holding that when a decedent domiciled \u000d\u000ain Senegal had two wives under Senegalese law it would not contravene New York's public policy to provide \u000d\u000athat the statutory share of a wrongful death award for a \u201csurviving spouse\u201d should be divided in two with each \u000d\u000aone-half share to be paid to each wife.

In the U.S., having spouse-like relationships with more \u000d\u000athan one person under the same roof was criminalized in 1882. Today, people in the U.S. are rarely prosecuted \u000d\u000afor living with multiple romantic partners, but every state has laws against getting married while already being \u000d\u000amarried to someone else.\u000d\u000aIn February, Utah passed a bill to reduce the penalties for adults who voluntarily live in polygamous \u000d\u000arelationships, making the practice an infraction, a low-level offense that is not punishable with jail time.\u000d\u000aIn other parts of the world, including swaths of the Middle East and Asia, polygamy is legal but not \u000d\u000apracticed widely. And in some countries \u2013 particularly in a segment of West and Central Africa known as the \u000d\u000apolygamy belt \u2013 the practice is frequently legal and widespread.\u000d\u000aA Pew Research Center report about living arrangements in 130 countries and territories published in 2019 \u000d\u000aanalyzed the number of people residing in polygamous households, as well as other types of households. Here \u000d\u000aare some key findings from that report, and from a separate study of customs and laws around the world.\u000d\u000aOnly about 2% of the global \u000d\u000apopulation lives in \u000d\u000apolygamous households, and \u000d\u000ain the vast majority of \u000d\u000acountries, that share is under \u000d\u000a0.5%. Polygamy is banned \u000d\u000athroughout much of the world, \u000d\u000aand the United Nations Human \u000d\u000aRights Committee, which has \u000d\u000asaid that \u201cpolygamy violates the \u000d\u000adignity of women,\u201d called for it \u000d\u000ato \u201cbe definitely abolished \u000d\u000awherever it continues to exist.\u201d \u000d\u000aBut there often are limits to \u000d\u000agovernment administration of \u000d\u000amarriages. In many countries,\u000d\u000amarriages are governed by \u000d\u000areligious or customary law, \u000d\u000awhich means that oversight is in \u000d\u000athe hands of clerics or \u000d\u000acommunity leaders.","Chapter 3: Cohabitation and Other Unions Page 55\u000d\u000aPolygamy is most often found in subSaharan Africa, where 11% of the \u000d\u000apopulation lives in arrangements that \u000d\u000ainclude more than one spouse. Polygamy is \u000d\u000awidespread in a cluster of countries in West \u000d\u000aand Central Africa, including Burkina Faso, \u000d\u000a(36%), Mali (34%) and Nigeria (28%). In \u000d\u000athese countries, polygamy is legal, at least to \u000d\u000asome extent. Muslims in Africa are more \u000d\u000alikely than Christians to live in this type of \u000d\u000aarrangement (25% vs. 3%), but in some \u000d\u000acountries, the practice also is widespread \u000d\u000aamong adherents of folk religions and people \u000d\u000awho do not identify with a religion. For \u000d\u000aexample, in Burkina Faso, 45% of people who \u000d\u000apractice folk religions, 40% of Muslims and \u000d\u000a24% of Christians live in polygamous \u000d\u000ahouseholds. Chad is the only country in this \u000d\u000aanalysis where Christians (21%) are more \u000d\u000alikely than Muslims (10%) to live in this type \u000d\u000aof arrangement.\u000d\u000aMany of the countries that permit \u000d\u000apolygamy have Muslim majorities, and the \u000d\u000apractice is rare in many of them. Fewer than \u000d\u000a1% of Muslim men live with more than one \u000d\u000aspouse in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, \u000d\u000aIran and Egypt \u2013 all countries where the \u000d\u000apractice is legal at least for Muslims. \u000d\u000aPolygamy is also legal in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, \u000d\u000athe United Arab Emirates and other neighboring countries, but these were not included in the study due to data \u000d\u000alimitations. Muslim supporters of polygamy often cite Quran verse 4:3, which instructs men to take as many \u000d\u000awives as they can take care of, up to four, and they also point out that the Prophet Muhammad had multiple \u000d\u000awives. Historians have noted that Islamic guidance on polygamy was issued amid wars in Arabia in the seventh \u000d\u000acentury, when there were many widows and orphans requiring financial support, and that polygamy created a \u000d\u000asystem for them to be cared for. To this day, polygamy is most common in places where people, and particularly \u000d\u000amen, tend to die young.\u000d\u000aThe Jewish Torah and Christian Old Testament refer to several instances of accepted plural \u000d\u000amarriages, including by Abraham, Jacob and David. However, the practice was disavowed by these groups \u000d\u000ain the Middle Ages, and polygamy generally has not been condoned by Jews or Christians in recent centuries. \u000d\u000aStill, polygamy sometimes was practiced by certain Christian sects, including by members of the Church of Jesus \u000d\u000aChrist of Latter-day Saints (sometimes called Mormons) in the U.S. until the late 1800s. Some Mormon splinter \u000d\u000agroups still practice polygamy.\u000d\u000aReligion often plays a role in how polygamy is governed and practiced within a single country. In Nigeria, \u000d\u000afor example, polygamous marriage is not allowed at the federal level, but the prohibition only applies to civil \u000d\u000amarriages. Twelve northern, Muslim-majority states do recognize these unions as Islamic or customary \u000d\u000amarriages. In India, Muslim men are allowed to marry multiple women, while men of other groups are not. \u000d\u000aHowever, in countries where polygamy is common, it often is practiced by people of all faiths. That\u2019s the case \u000d\u000ain Gambia, Niger, Mali, Chad and Burkina Faso, where at least one-in-ten people in every religious group \u000d\u000ameasured live in households that include husbands with more than one spouse.","Chapter 3: Cohabitation and Other Unions Page 56\u000d\u000aPolygamy usually takes the form of polygyny \u2013 when a man \u000d\u000amarries multiple women. Polyandry, which refers to wives \u000d\u000ahaving more than one husband, is even rarer than polygamy \u000d\u000aand mostly documented among small and relatively isolated \u000d\u000acommunities around the world. While polygamy laws are \u000d\u000ausually skewed in favor of allowing men \u2013 but not women \u2013 to \u000d\u000atake multiple spouses, many countries\u2019 laws also speak to the \u000d\u000arights of women. In Burkina Faso, for example, where \u000d\u000apolygamy is common, spouses must agree that a marriage will \u000d\u000abe polygamous at its outset for the husband to be allowed to \u000d\u000atake another wife in the future. In Djibouti, a judge records the \u000d\u000aexisting wives\u2019 opinions on any new marriages and \u000d\u000ainvestigates the husband\u2019s socioeconomic situation before \u000d\u000aapproving a marriage contract with an additional wife.\u000d\u000aOne-in-five U.S. adults believe that polygamy is morally \u000d\u000aacceptable, a recent Gallup poll found. This share has almost \u000d\u000atripled (from 7%) since the question was first asked in 2003, \u000d\u000abut is still among the least accepted behaviors Gallup asks \u000d\u000aabout. Self-described liberals are much more likely than \u000d\u000aconservatives to see polygamy as morally acceptable (34% vs. \u000d\u000a9%). A Pew Research Center survey published in 2013 found \u000d\u000athat Muslims around the world are divided about polygamy: \u000d\u000aWhile majorities in several sub-Saharan African countries and \u000d\u000apluralities in parts of the Middle East describe polygamy as \u000d\u000amorally acceptable, Muslims living in Central Asia as well as \u000d\u000aSouthern and Eastern Europe tend to say that polygamy is \u000d\u000aimmoral.","Chapter 3: Cohabitation and Other Unions Page 57\u000d\u000aPolygamy Research Briefing\u000d\u000aBy Catherine Fairbairn, Melanie Gower, Steven Kennedy\u000d\u000aHouse of Commons Library\u000d\u000aFebruary 1, 2023\u000d\u000aSummary \u000d\u000aHome Office guidance for HM Passport Office staff \u000d\u000adefines a polygamous marriage as when a man \u000d\u000alegally has multiple spouses (a woman with \u000d\u000amultiple spouses is called a polyandrous marriage). \u000d\u000aThis briefing paper deals with when polygamous \u000d\u000amarriages might be legally recognized in England \u000d\u000aand Wales; immigration issues; social security \u000d\u000abenefits and state pension entitlement. \u000d\u000aLegal recognition \u000d\u000aTo be recognized as legally valid, all \u000d\u000amarriages which take place in the United Kingdom \u000d\u000amust be monogamous and must be carried out in \u000d\u000aaccordance with the requirements of the relevant \u000d\u000alegislation. \u000d\u000aFor a polygamous marriage to be \u000d\u000aconsidered valid in the UK, the parties must be \u000d\u000adomiciled in a country where polygamous marriage \u000d\u000ais permitted and must have entered into the marriage \u000d\u000ain a country which permits polygamy. \u000d\u000aThere is some anecdotal evidence of people \u000d\u000aentering into a form of polygamous marriage in the \u000d\u000aUK through religious ceremonies that are not \u000d\u000aregistered by the state and are not recognized under \u000d\u000aUK law. \u000d\u000aParties to these relationships do not have \u000d\u000athe same rights as legally married couples, such as \u000d\u000aaccess to financial remedies on divorce or automatic \u000d\u000ainheritance rights on the death of one of the parties. \u000d\u000aCalls have been made for all marriages taking place \u000d\u000ain England and Wales to be registered as a way of \u000d\u000aaddressing this issue \u2013 it would not be possible to \u000d\u000aregister a polygamous marriage. \u000d\u000aIn 2022, the Law Commission \u000d\u000arecommended comprehensive reform of weddings \u000d\u000alaw in England and Wales. The reformed system \u000d\u000awould be based on regulation of the officiant \u000d\u000aresponsible for the ceremony. Among other things, \u000d\u000athe Law Commission recommended it would be an \u000d\u000aoffence for a person \u2013 an officiant or a person \u000d\u000apurporting to be an officiant or leading the \u000d\u000aceremony \u2013 dishonestly to mislead a couple about \u000d\u000athe effect of a ceremony. It would also be an offence \u000d\u000afor an authorized officiant not to disclose to the \u000d\u000acouple if the ceremony will not give rise to a valid \u000d\u000amarriage. \u000d\u000aThe Government has said it will publish a \u000d\u000aresponse to the Law Commission\u2019s report in due \u000d\u000acourse. \u000d\u000aNo formal assessment is made of the \u000d\u000anumber of polygamous households.\u000d\u000aImmigration issues \u000d\u000aIt has been the policy of successive \u000d\u000agovernments to prevent the formation of \u000d\u000apolygamous households in the UK. \u000d\u000aIn short, a UK resident cannot sponsor a \u000d\u000anon-British/Irish national for permission to enter or \u000d\u000aremain in the UK as their spouse if another person \u000d\u000ahas already been granted such permission, and the \u000d\u000amarriage has not been dissolved. These restrictions \u000d\u000aare set out in section 2 of the Immigration Act 1988 \u000d\u000aand paragraphs 278 - 280 of the Immigration Rules. \u000d\u000aHowever, it is possible for all parties to a \u000d\u000apolygamous marriage to be legally present in the \u000d\u000aUK. For example, a second spouse may qualify for \u000d\u000aentry to the UK in a different immigration category, \u000d\u000ain their own right. \u000d\u000aSocial security benefits \u000d\u000aFor polygamous marriages considered \u000d\u000avalid in the UK, an award of certain means-tested \u000d\u000abenefits and tax credits can be for more than one \u000d\u000aspouse. Any additional amount payable for the \u000d\u000asecond spouse is however likely to be less than the \u000d\u000aamount they could get were they to make a separate \u000d\u000aclaim as a single person. \u000d\u000aUniversal Credit (UC) is replacing meanstested benefits and tax credits for working age \u000d\u000apeople. Polygamous marriages are not recognised in \u000d\u000athe UC rules.

Not every country allows \u000d\u000apolygamy, bigamy is where polygamy is \u000d\u000anot legal, and a person cannot have \u000d\u000amultiple spouses.\u000d\u000a1.2 Polygamous marriages which take place \u000d\u000ain the UK: not legally valid \u000d\u000aTo be recognised as legally valid, all \u000d\u000amarriages which take place in the United Kingdom \u000d\u000amust be monogamous and must be carried out in \u000d\u000aaccordance with the requirements of the Marriage \u000d\u000aAct 1949 (as amended), the Marriage Act \u000d\u000a(Scotland) 1977 or the Marriage Order (Northern \u000d\u000aIreland) 2003. \u000d\u000aBigamy, rather than polygamy, is a \u000d\u000acriminal offence. This was confirmed in a written \u000d\u000aanswer in October 2011 by the then AttorneyGeneral. The crime of bigamy is committed by \u000d\u000asomeone who, whilst still legally married to a \u000d\u000asurviving spouse, goes through a ceremony of \u000d\u000amarriage that purports to be legally binding. A \u000d\u000aperson does not commit bigamy where, for \u000d\u000aexample, they contract an unregistered religious \u000d\u000amarriage in England, without disclosing the \u000d\u000aexistence of a subsisting marriage.\u000d\u000a1.3 Polygamous marriages which take place \u000d\u000ain another country: may be recognised \u000d\u000aPolygamous marriages which take place in \u000d\u000aanother country, and are valid there, may be \u000d\u000arecognised as being valid in the UK. Home Office \u000d\u000aguidance provides further information. \u000d\u000aIn a written answer in April 2008, Lord \u000d\u000aHunt of Kings Heath, then a junior Justice Minister, \u000d\u000aset out the conditions and reasons for recognition of \u000d\u000aa polygamous marriage: \u000d\u000aFor a polygamous marriage to be \u000d\u000aconsidered valid in the UK, the parties \u000d\u000amust be domiciled in a country where \u000d\u000apolygamous marriage is permitted, and \u000d\u000amust have entered into the marriage in that \u000d\u000acountry. Provided the parties follow the \u000d\u000anecessary requirements under the law of \u000d\u000athe country in question, the marriage would \u000d\u000abe recognised in England and Wales. The \u000d\u000alaw is drafted thus because the Government \u000d\u000ahave no desire forcibly to sever \u000d\u000arelationships that have been lawfully \u000d\u000acontracted in other jurisdictions. This \u000d\u000ashould not, however, be construed as \u000d\u000agovernment approval of polygamous \u000d\u000amarriage. The Government do not support \u000d\u000apolygamous marriage and support the law \u000d\u000athat prohibits parties from contracting \u000d\u000apolygamous marriages in this jurisdiction.\u000d\u000aIn October 2011, the Coalition \u000d\u000aGovernment again confirmed that polygamous \u000d\u000amarriages may sometimes be recognised: \u000d\u000aPolygamous marriages cannot be legally \u000d\u000aformed in the UK. Nor is it possible for \u000d\u000aanyone domiciled in the United Kingdom \u000d\u000ato enter into a polygamous marriage \u000d\u000aabroad. Where a polygamous marriage is \u000d\u000acontracted outside the United Kingdom \u000d\u000abetween parties, neither of whom is \u000d\u000adomiciled in the United Kingdom, it will be \u000d\u000arecognised.\u000d\u000aSection 11(d) of the Matrimonial Causes \u000d\u000aAct 1973 (as amended) provides that a polygamous \u000d\u000amarriage entered into outside England and Wales \u000d\u000aafter 31 July 1971 is void if either party to the \u000d\u000amarriage was, at the time, domiciled in England and \u000d\u000aWales.\u000d\u000a1.4 Unregistered religious marriages","Chapter 3: Cohabitation and Other Unions Page 59\u000d\u000aUnregistered religious marriages are not \u000d\u000arecognised under marriage law in England and \u000d\u000aWales and are generally regarded as \u201cnonmarriages\u201d. The law generally treats parties to a \u000d\u000amarriage which is not legally recognised as \u000d\u000acohabitants. \u000d\u000aThe consequences of being in an \u000d\u000aunregistered marriage, and treated as a cohabitant, \u000d\u000amay be felt particularly when the relationship ends, \u000d\u000awhether on death or because it breaks down. In \u000d\u000aOctober 2011, Jonathan Djanogly, then a junior \u000d\u000aJustice Minister, set out information about the \u000d\u000aconsequences of entering into such a marriage in the \u000d\u000aUK: \u000d\u000aThere is some anecdotal evidence of people \u000d\u000aentering into polygamous marriage in the \u000d\u000aUK through religious ceremonies that are \u000d\u000anot registered by the state and are not \u000d\u000arecognised under UK law. Due to the fact \u000d\u000athat these marriages are not legally \u000d\u000arecognised there is no indication of how \u000d\u000amany such polygamous relationships exist. \u000d\u000aAny parties to such relationships do not \u000d\u000ashare the same rights as a legally married \u000d\u000acouple, such as access to financial \u000d\u000aremedies available on divorce or \u000d\u000ainheritance rights on the death of one of the \u000d\u000aspouses, and are treated as cohabitants. The \u000d\u000aGovernment have carried out some work \u000d\u000awith the Muslim community to encourage \u000d\u000amosques to undertake the civil aspects of \u000d\u000amarriage and to raise awareness of the need \u000d\u000afor marriages to be legally recognised.\u000d\u000aThe Casey Review into opportunity and \u000d\u000aintegration, published in December 2016, found \u000d\u000a\u201cthe practice of \u2018unregistered polygamy\u2019 appears to \u000d\u000abe more commonplace than might be expected\u201d, \u000d\u000aand that this gives rise to a power imbalance: \u2026\u000d\u000aThe existence of matchmaking sites like \u000d\u000a\u201csecondwife.com\u201d and a number of \u000d\u000aaccusations, anecdotes and assertions \u000d\u000aencountered throughout our engagement \u000d\u000aimply a common acceptance of polygamy \u000d\u000a\u2013 which impact negatively on women (and \u000d\u000atheir children) who have not had a legal \u000d\u000amarriage, through denial of inheritance and \u000d\u000amaintenance rights \u2013 even if most people \u000d\u000awould not wish the situation upon \u000d\u000athemselves.

Civ. 1re, 17 \u000d\u000aNovember 2021, n\u00b020-19.420). The Court held that \u000d\u000aa bigamous marriage is not automatically void \u000d\u000aunder French law when the spouses are foreign \u000d\u000anationals. Indeed, the French choice of law rule on \u000d\u000athe validity of marriage provides for the application \u000d\u000aof the law of the spouses\u2019 common nationality \u000d\u000a(article 202-1 of the Civil Code). Therefore, the \u000d\u000alower court is required to designate on its own \u000d\u000amotion the applicable law to the marriage to assess \u000d\u000aits validity.\u000d\u000aFacts and Issue at Stake\u000d\u000aA couple, both Libyan nationals, married in \u000d\u000a2000 in Libya. On November 2017, the wife filed a \u000d\u000apetition for divorce before French court. The lower \u000d\u000acourt ruled that the request for divorce was \u000d\u000ainadmissible, because the husband was already \u000d\u000amarried in Libya before this marriage. French law \u000d\u000aprohibits bigamy pursuant to article 147 of the Civil \u000d\u000aCode. As a result, the lower court had held that the \u000d\u000asecond marriage \u201chas no legal existence\u201d and thus \u000d\u000acannot be dissolved by a French court.\u000d\u000aThe wife appealed to the French Supreme \u000d\u000aCourt based on a traditional conflict-of-law \u000d\u000areasoning. She argued that the lower court should \u000d\u000ahave checked whether the personal law of the \u000d\u000aspouses (as applicable law to marriage pursuant \u000d\u000ato article 202-1, op. cit.) did authorize bigamy. If so, \u000d\u000athe second marriage, celebrated abroad, could \u000d\u000aproduce effects in France and thus be dissolved by \u000d\u000aa French court.\u000d\u000aLegal Background\u000d\u000aUnder French domestic family law, article \u000d\u000a147 of the French Civil Code lays down the \u000d\u000aprinciple of monogamy. French criminal law \u000d\u000apunishes a spouse guilty of bigamy (article 433-20 \u000d\u000aof the Penal Code). At the same time, comparative \u000d\u000alaw reveals that some foreign legal systems allow \u000d\u000apolygamy. Even if this institution is in sharp \u000d\u000acontrasts to Western socio-cultural values, the \u000d\u000aglobal mobility of persons requires to pay attention \u000d\u000ato a possible acceptance of such marriages in the \u000d\u000aFrench forum.\u000d\u000aRemarkably, the French legal system has \u000d\u000atraditionally adopted a nuanced position, depending \u000d\u000aon the proximity that the situation of bigamy or \u000d\u000apolygamy has with the forum. In France, no \u000d\u000abigamous or, a fortiori, polygamous marriage can \u000d\u000abe validly celebrated, even if the second marriage is \u000d\u000aconcluded between the same persons, already \u000d\u000amarried abroad (Civ. 1re, 3 February 2004, n\u00b000-\u000d\u000a19.838). The situation is different when the bigamy \u000d\u000ais not \u201ccreated\u201d in France, but was legally \u000d\u000aestablished abroad. The second marriage may then, \u000d\u000ain certain circumstances, be recognised in France \u000d\u000aand produce certain effects (e.g. in the field of social \u000d\u000asecurity rights or succession). In these latter \u000d\u000acircumstances, two hypotheses must be \u000d\u000adistinguished.\u000d\u000aEither the national law of one of the \u000d\u000aspouses (pursuant to article 202-1 of the Civil Code) \u000d\u000adoes not allow bigamy. French law will consider \u000d\u000athis prohibition as constituting an absolute \u000d\u000aimpediment to marriage prevailing over the more \u000d\u000aliberal content of the national law of the other \u000d\u000aspouse. French authorities will therefore refuse to \u000d\u000agive effect to this marriage in France. For instance, \u000d\u000aa second marriage, validly celebrated abroad, of a \u000d\u000aforeign spouse whose personal status admits \u000d\u000apolygamy, with a French woman, cannot be \u000d\u000arecognised in France (Civ. 1re, 28 January 2002, \u000d\u000an\u00b000-15789).\u000d\u000aOr the personal status of the spouses, i.e. \u000d\u000atheir common or own national law, authorises \u000d\u000apolygamy. The French court may, to a certain \u000d\u000aextent, recognise the second marriage (and make it \u000d\u000aproduce effects) by attenuating the \u201ceviction\u201d \u000d\u000aimpact of the French fundamental values (effet \u000d\u000aatt\u00e9nu\u00e9 de l\u2019ordre public). This has been held by the \u000d\u000aFrench Supreme Court on several occasions (Civ. \u000d\u000a1re, 28 January 1958, Chemouni and more \u000d\u000arecently Civ. 2e, 14 February 2007, n\u00b005-21.816).","Chapter 3: Cohabitation and Other Unions Page 61\u000d\u000aSolution and Legal Reasoning\u000d\u000aIn the present case, the lower court ruled on \u000d\u000aa domestic law basis. The case, however, was \u000d\u000ainternational and required a conflict-of-law analysis \u000d\u000asince the parties may not dispose of their rights. It \u000d\u000ais worth recalling that French PIL does not provide \u000d\u000afor a systematic mandatory application of choice of \u000d\u000alaw rules. But French courts are required to apply \u000d\u000aconflict-of-law rules in non-patrimonial matters, \u000d\u000asuch as personal status issues, since the parties may \u000d\u000anot dispose of their rights. They even have to \u000d\u000adetermine the applicable law ex officio (comp. \u000d\u000arecently on the context of EU PIL, Civ. 1re, 26 May \u000d\u000a2021, n\u00b019-15.102, commented on the \u000d\u000ablog here and here).\u000d\u000aIn the absence of French written rules of \u000d\u000aPIL, the French Supreme Court has traditionally \u000d\u000abased this solution on article 3 of the French Civil \u000d\u000aCode. It was the only \u201cinternational\u201d provision in \u000d\u000athe Code Napoleon at the time of the judicial \u000d\u000adevelopment of PIL rules in the French legal \u000d\u000asystem. Unfortunately, it may be confusing for the \u000d\u000areader, since article 3 makes no mention whatsoever \u000d\u000aof the court\u2019s role in conflict-of-law matters. This is \u000d\u000aa strong point in favor of a (forthcoming?) French \u000d\u000aPIL codification.\u000d\u000aThis is the ground on which the French \u000d\u000aSupreme Court annulled the judgment of the Court \u000d\u000aof appeal in this case: in the field of marriage, \u000d\u000aconflict-of-law rules are mandatory. The lower \u000d\u000acourt should have verified, in accordance with the \u000d\u000apersonal law of the spouses pursuant to article 202-\u000d\u000a1 of the Civil Code, whether the foreign bigamous \u000d\u000amarriage was valid (so that, in the affirmative, it \u000d\u000acould be dissolved). At that stage of the reasoning, \u000d\u000athe French prohibition of bigamy pursuant to article \u000d\u000a147 of the Civil Code did not matter.\u000d\u000aAssessment\u000d\u000aWe could maybe regret that the Supreme \u000d\u000aCourt does not provide for the full PIL reasoning in \u000d\u000aorder to be more informative. It will be indeed for \u000d\u000athe lower court to proceed to the second step of the \u000d\u000achoice of law analysis. The validity of the foreign \u000d\u000amarriage could be denied, despite its validity under \u000d\u000athe applicable law, on the basis of public policy. If \u000d\u000athe content of foreign law infringes the fundamental \u000d\u000avalues of French society, a French court may \u000d\u000adisplace it and apply French law instead.\u000d\u000aThere is, however, a limit mentioned \u000d\u000aabove: in order to protect rights acquired abroad and \u000d\u000athe permanence of the status of individuals across \u000d\u000aborders, the effect of public policy may be limited \u000d\u000a(effet att\u00e9nu\u00e9 de l\u2019ordre public). This has \u000d\u000atraditionally been the case in the field of polygamy \u000d\u000awhen it is allowed under the personal status of the \u000d\u000aspouses (see above). The lower court should thus \u000d\u000aexclude the eviction of the foreign law despite its \u000d\u000asharp cultural difference with French substantive \u000d\u000afamily law and consider the foreign marriage as \u000d\u000avalid.\u000d\u000aIn this case, the bigamous marriage should \u000d\u000abe recognised so that the second wife is allowed to \u000d\u000adivorce. In other words, as a matter of policy, the \u000d\u000aprivate interests of the second wife should prevail. \u000d\u000aWhether this view would be shared by all Member \u000d\u000aStates in the implementation of the EU PIL \u000d\u000ainstruments on family matters is another matter.","Chapter 3: Cohabitation and Other Unions Page 62\u000d\u000aUtah Lowers Penalty for Polygamy, No Longer a Felony\u000d\u000aBy: Christine Hauser, The New York Times\u000d\u000ahttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/13/us/utah-bigamy-law.html\u000d\u000aMay 13, 2020\u000d\u000aAn amendment that went into effect this week allows polygamy to be punished as an infraction in some cases, \u000d\u000abut it remains a felony if force, threats or other abuses are involved.\u000d\u000aA new law that took effect in Utah this week has \u000d\u000alowered the punishment for polygamy in some \u000d\u000acases, making it an infraction similar to a traffic \u000d\u000asummons instead of a felony punishable by a prison \u000d\u000aterm.\u000d\u000aUnder Senate Bill 102, which was signed \u000d\u000ainto law by Gov.

INTRODUCTION\u000d\u000aThis case concerns a constitutional challenge to Utah\u2019s bigamy statute, Utah Code Annotated \u00a7 76\u20137\u2013101 (\u201cthe \u000d\u000aStatute\u201d), which provides:\u000d\u000a(1) A person is guilty of bigamy when, knowing he has a husband or wife or knowing the other person has a husband \u000d\u000aor wife, the person purports to marry another person or cohabits with another person.\u000d\u000a(2) Bigamy is a felony of the third degree.\u000d\u000a(3) It shall be a defense to bigamy that the accused reasonably believed he and the other person were legally eligible \u000d\u000ato remarry.\u000d\u000aExercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we hold this matter is moot. It is not a \u201cCase\u201d or \u201cControversy\u201d under \u000d\u000aArticle III of the U.S. Constitution. We remand to the district court with instructions to vacate the judgment and \u000d\u000adismiss this action.\u000d\u000aKody Brown, Meri Brown, Janelle Brown, Christine Brown, and Robyn Sullivan (\u201cthe Browns\u201d) form a \u201cplural \u000d\u000afamily.\u201d Kody Brown is legally married to Meri Brown and \u201cspiritually married\u201d to the other three women, whom he \u000d\u000acalls \u201csister wives.\u201d When the family became the subject of a TLC reality television show in 2010, the Lehi Police \u000d\u000aDepartment opened an investigation of the Browns for violating the Statute. The Browns then filed a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\u000d\u000aaction in federal district court against the Governor and Attorney General of the State of Utah and the Utah County \u000d\u000aAttorney. Claiming the Statute infringed their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights, the Browns sought declaratory \u000d\u000arelief and a permanent injunction enjoining enforcement of the Statute against them.\u000d\u000aThe district court dismissed the Governor and Attorney General. The Utah County Attorney\u2019s Office (\u201cUCAO\u201d) \u000d\u000asubsequently closed its file on the Browns and adopted a policy (\u201cthe UCAO Policy\u201d) under which the Utah County \u000d\u000aAttorney will bring bigamy prosecutions only against those who (1) induce a partner to marry through \u000d\u000amisrepresentation or (2) are suspected of committing a collateral crime such as fraud or abuse. The Browns fall into \u000d\u000aneither category. Nonetheless, the district court denied the Utah County Attorney\u2019s motion to dismiss the case as moot ","Chapter 3: Cohabitation and Other Unions Page 65\u000d\u000aand instead granted summary judgment to the Browns.\u000d\u000aThe district court erred by proceeding to the merits. Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. They lack power \u000d\u000ato decide issues\u2014however important or fiercely contested\u2014that are detached from a live dispute between the parties. \u000d\u000aFollowing adoption of the UCAO Policy, the Browns\u2019 suit ceased to qualify as an Article III case or controversy. \u000d\u000aTheir suit was moot before the district court awarded them relief, and the court therefore lacked jurisdiction to decide \u000d\u000athe Browns\u2019 claims.\u000d\u000aII. BACKGROUND\u000d\u000aA. Factual Background\u000d\u000aKody Brown, a former resident of Lehi, Utah, is legally married to Meri Brown. He is also \u201cspiritually married\u201d\u2014but \u000d\u000anot legally married\u2014to Janelle Brown, Christine Brown, and Robyn Sullivan, who \u201cconsider themselves committed \u000d\u000ato him as \u2018sister wives.\u2019\u201d Together, the Browns form a \u201cplural family.\u201d \u000d\u000aThe Browns belong to the Apostolic United Brethren Church (\u201cAUB\u201d), which views polygamy as \u201ca core religious \u000d\u000apractice.\u201d Consistent with AUB teaching, they \u201cbelieve that only through celestial marriage can they ensure the \u000d\u000asalvation of their souls following death.\u201d \u000d\u000aIn September 2010, TLC began airing \u201cSister Wives,\u201d a reality television show featuring the Browns that \u201cexplores \u000d\u000athe daily issues and realities of a plural family.\u201d On the show, the Browns have discussed their religious belief in \u000d\u000apolygamy and defended their polygamist lifestyle.\u000d\u000aViewers of the show contacted the Lehi Police Department to \u201cinquir[e] what the department intended to do\u201d about \u000d\u000athe Browns. The day after the first episode aired, the Department publicly announced it was investigating the Browns \u000d\u000afor violations of the Statute.\u000d\u000aIn October 2010, the Lehi Police Department forwarded the results of its investigation to the UCAO. Following \u000d\u000astandard practice, the UCAO opened a case file on the Browns. Fearful they would be criminally prosecuted, the \u000d\u000aBrowns moved to Nevada in January 2011. Mr. Buhman was quoted in a January 2011 media report as saying that \u000d\u000adespite the Browns\u2019 move, his office would not rule out the possibility of prosecution.\u000d\u000aB. Procedural Background\u000d\u000a1. The Browns\u2019 Complaint\u000d\u000aOn July 13, 2011, before the UCAO had completed its investigation, the Browns filed suit in the U.S. District Court \u000d\u000afor the District of Utah. Their complaint named Jeffrey Buhman, County Attorney for Utah County; Gary Herbert, \u000d\u000aGovernor of the State of Utah; and Mark Shurtleff, Attorney General of the State of Utah (collectively, \u201cDefendants\u201d), \u000d\u000aall in their official capacities.\u000d\u000aThe Browns alleged the Statute violates:\u000d\u000a(1) their substantive due process right \u201cto freely make personal decisions relating to procreation, \u000d\u000acontraception, family relationships, and child rearing,\u201d both on its face and as applied, and the due process \u000d\u000aright not to be subject to vague criminal laws; \u000d\u000a(2) the Equal Protection Clause, both on its face and as applied, because it treats religiously motivated \u000d\u000apolygamists differently from other people; \u000d\u000a(3) their right to the free exercise of religion, both on its face and as applied; \u000d\u000a(4) their free speech rights because prosecutors used the Statute to single them out based on their public \u000d\u000astatements endorsing polygamy; \u000d\u000a(5) their freedom of association, both on its face and as applied, because its application has deprived the \u000d\u000aBrowns of \u201cthe right to associate with other like-minded citizens who believe that consenting adults should ","Chapter 3: Cohabitation and Other Unions Page 66\u000d\u000abe able to maintain private relations and unions without interference from the state,\u201d; and \u000d\u000a(6) the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. In their seventh and final cause of action, the Browns \u000d\u000aasserted Defendants were \u201cin violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\u201d because they had deprived the Browns of their \u000d\u000aconstitutional rights while acting under color of state law.\u000d\u000aThe Browns\u2019 prayer for relief requested (1) a \u201cdeclar[ation] that [the Statute] violates the Due Process and Equal \u000d\u000aProtection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Free Exercise, Establishment, Free Speech, and Freedom of \u000d\u000aAssociation Clauses of the First Amendment, and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\u201d; (2) a \u201cpreliminary and permanent injunction \u000d\u000aenjoining enforcement or application of [the Statute] against the Brown family\u201d; (3) an award of \u201creasonable attorneys\u2019 \u000d\u000afees and costs incurred in maintaining this action\u201d; and (4) \u201csuch other relief as [the district court] may deem just and \u000d\u000aproper.\u201d \u000d\u000aIn asserting the district court\u2019s jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(a)(4), the complaint explained that \u201cthis action \u000d\u000aseeks equitable relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, an Act of Congress.\u201d Additionally, the complaint\u2019s \u201cNature of the \u000d\u000aAction\u201d section provides, \u201cThrough this action, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, the Brown family seeks a declaration \u000d\u000athat [the Statute] is unconstitutional.... The Browns further seek a preliminary and permanent injunction preventing \u000d\u000athe Defendants from enforcing the [Statute] against the Browns.\u201d The complaint expressly disclaimed any request for \u000d\u000aa declaration that the Statute and the Utah Constitution \u201care unconstitutional to the extent that they merely prohibit \u000d\u000athe official recognition of polygamous marriage or the acquisition of multiple state marriage licenses.\u201d Finally, the \u000d\u000acomplaint did not request money damages.\u000d\u000a2. Defendants\u2019 Motions to Dismiss\u000d\u000aDefendants filed two separate motions to dismiss in district court. One was granted in part; the other was denied.\u000d\u000aa. Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Standing\u000d\u000aOn September 2, 2011, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, arguing the Browns lacked standing to press their claims.\u000d\u000aAttached to that motion was a declaration signed by Mr. Shurtleff, in which he declared his office had a \u201cpolicy ... not \u000d\u000ato prosecute polygamists under Utah\u2019s criminal bigamy statute for just the sake of their practicing polygamy\u201d (\u201cthe \u000d\u000aAG Policy\u201d). Under the AG Policy, Mr. Shurtleff\u2019s office initiates prosecutions under the Statute only against someone \u000d\u000awho also \u201ccommit[s] child or spouse abuse, domestic violence, welfare fraud, or any other crime.\u201d He said his \u000d\u000a\u201cpredecessors in recent memory\u201d had followed the AG Policy, and he was unaware of cases brought \u201cagainst a \u000d\u000apolygamist just for violating the bigamy law in the last fifty years unless it is in conjunction with another crime.\u201d In \u000d\u000aaddition, Mr. Shurtleff attested \u201c[i]t [wa]s not the intent of the Utah Attorney General\u2019s Office to prosecute the Browns \u000d\u000afor their practice of polygamy while they were living in Lehi, Utah, unless it [wa]s found that they were also \u000d\u000acommitting some other crime worthy of prosecution.\u201d\u000d\u000aDefendants also attached a declaration from Mr. Buhman signed under penalty of perjury. Although the UCAO \u201cd[id] \u000d\u000anot have a formal, declared policy regarding prosecution of polygamy,\u201d he said no one on his staff \u201cha[d] any \u000d\u000arecollection of [the UCAO] having ever prosecuted anyone for polygamy.\u201d He added, however, that he had \u201cnot stated \u000d\u000apublically that [he] w[ould] or w[ould] not prosecute the Browns.\u201d Mr. Buhman also declared that the UCAO \u201chas on \u000d\u000aoccasion prosecuted a bigamy case for marriage fraud or for a failure to get divorced before remarrying.\u201d \u201cWere the \u000d\u000aBrowns committing other crimes, such as spousal or child abuse, welfare fraud or the like,\u201d he stated, \u201cthe chance of \u000d\u000aprosecution would be likely.\u201d\u000d\u000aDefendants argued the Browns lacked standing because the AG Policy and the UCAO\u2019s non-enforcement of the \u000d\u000aStatute made prosecution unlikely.\u000d\u000aOn December 19, 2011, Defendants supplemented the record with a declaration from Amanda Jex, a law clerk in the \u000d\u000aAttorney General\u2019s Office who had been \u201cassigned the task of researching prosecution of polygamists in Utah \u000d\u000asubsequent to their public appearances.\u201d Id. at 176. She had asked the Administrative Office of the Courts for the State \u000d\u000aof Utah to provide a list of cases brought under the Statute in the preceding ten years. The Administrative Office \u000d\u000aresponded with a list of ten defendants prosecuted under the Statute between 2001 and 2011. The list did not indicate ","Chapter 3: Cohabitation and Other Unions Page 67\u000d\u000awhether defendants charged under the Statute were also charged with collateral crimes.\u000d\u000aTo determine whether those ten defendants had also been charged with collateral crimes, Ms. Jex ran \u201cinternet queries \u000d\u000athrough Google.com, and Utah based news agencies such as: KSL.com, the Salt Lake Tribune, the Deseret News and \u000d\u000aThe Spectrum. She also conducted research on Court XChange, an online database operated by the Utah courts. Her \u000d\u000adeclaration does not indicate whether she checked actual court dockets or records or contacted court clerk\u2019s offices \u000d\u000afor information. There is no evidence in the record regarding prosecutions before 2001.\u000d\u000aOf the ten cases Ms. Jex identified in her declaration, six\u2014including two in Utah County\u2014involved defendants who \u000d\u000awere also prosecuted for crimes other than bigamy, such as criminal non-support, unlawful sexual conduct with a \u000d\u000aminor, forcible sex abuse, marriage license fraud, and insurance fraud. Ms. Jex\u2019s \u201cinternet queries\u201d did not reveal \u000d\u000aadditional charges in the four remaining cases, one of which involved a defendant charged in Utah County in 2010. \u000d\u000aBut prosecutors dismissed the charges in three of those cases, including the Utah County case. The final defendant \u000d\u000awas found guilty in Weber County of \u201c[a]ttempted bigamy.\u201d \u000d\u000aOn February 3, 2012, the district court dismissed Governor Herbert and Attorney General Shurtleff, concluding, based \u000d\u000aon the latter\u2019s declaration, that \u201cnothing suggest[s] that the State of Utah has taken any action towards [the Browns] \u000d\u000athat could be interpreted as threatening prosecution.\u201d Brown v. Herbert, 850 F.Supp.2d 1240, 1249 (D.Utah 2012). \u000d\u000aBut the court denied dismissal of Mr. Buhman. Noting the UCAO\u2019s lack of an official prosecution policy, the court \u000d\u000asaid, \u201cMr. Buhman ha[d] submitted nothing to the court that either counters [the Browns\u2019] account of the events, or \u000d\u000aotherwise suggests that the prosecutorial door is not wide open.\u201d The Browns faced \u201ca credible threat of prosecution,\u201d \u000d\u000athe court concluded, and therefore had standing to bring their claims. \u000d\u000ab. Mr. Buhman\u2019s Motion to Dismiss for Mootness\u000d\u000aFour months later, on May 31, 2012, Mr. Buhman filed a motion to dismiss the Browns\u2019 suit as constitutionally moot. \u000d\u000aThe motion was based on a second declaration Mr. Buhman had signed on May 22, 2012, in which he announced he \u000d\u000ahad \u201cnow adopted a formal office policy\u201d regarding polygamy prosecutions\u2014the UCAO Policy. The UCAO Policy, \u000d\u000awhich essentially adopts the AG Policy, provides:\u000d\u000aProsecution of Bigamy Crimes:\u000d\u000aThe Utah County Attorney\u2019s Office will prosecute the crime of bigamy under [the Statute] in \u000d\u000atwo circumstances: (1) When a victim is induced to marry through their partner\u2019s fraud, \u000d\u000amisrepresentation or omissions; or (2) When a person purports to marry or cohabits with another \u000d\u000aperson in violation of [the Statute] and is also engaged in some type of abuse, violence or fraud. \u000d\u000aThis office will prosecute the crime of child bigamy under Section 76\u20137\u2013101.5 regardless of \u000d\u000awhether one of the parties is also engaged in some type of abuse, violence or fraud.\u000d\u000aAccording to Mr. Buhman\u2019s declaration, the UCAO Policy was \u201cintended ... to prevent the future prosecution in Utah \u000d\u000aCounty of bigamous marriages entered into for religious reasons.\u201d\u000d\u000aMr. Buhman also attested that the UCAO \u201cha[d] concluded its investigation of the Browns and ha[d] determined that \u000d\u000ano other prosecutable crimes related to the bigamy allegation have been or are being committed by the Browns in \u000d\u000aUtah County as of the date of this declaration.\u201d As a result, he wrote, \u201cthe criminal case against the Browns is closed \u000d\u000aand no charges will be filed against them for bigamy unless new evidence is discovered which would comport with \u000d\u000athe [UCAO Policy] pertaining to the prosecution of bigamy crimes.\u201d The district court concluded in its subsequent \u000d\u000asummary judgment order and memorandum that it was undisputed Mr. Buhman had \u201cfound no evidence of any crime \u000d\u000aby the Browns.\u201d \u000d\u000aOn August 17, 2012, the district court denied Mr. Buhman\u2019s motion. It reasoned that the \u201ctiming of Mr. Buhman\u2019s \u000d\u000aadoption of the [UCAO Policy]\u201d\u201418 months after \u201cSister Wives\u201d began airing and four months after the initial motion \u000d\u000ato dismiss was denied\u2014suggested a \u201cstrategic attempt to use the mootness doctrine to evade review.\u201d The court also \u000d\u000anoted that the UCAO Policy \u201cdoes not reject the ability of Utah County to prosecute under the anti-bigamy statute\u201d \u000d\u000aand \u201creflects, at most, an exercise of prosecutorial discretion.\u201d Accordingly, the court denied the Browns\u2019 case was ","Chapter 3: Cohabitation and Other Unions Page 68\u000d\u000aconstitutionally moot because it could not \u201cconclude that there is no reasonable expectation that [the Browns] would \u000d\u000abe prosecuted under the statute in the future.\u201d \u000d\u000aTaking up the question of prudential mootness sua sponte, the district court concluded similar considerations \u000d\u000acounseled against dismissing the case on that basis.4 The district court wrote that \u201cthe timing of the [UCAO Policy] \u000d\u000aimplementation, lack of any public notice, and lack of reasoning given for adopting the [UCAO Policy] suggest that \u000d\u000athe [UCAO Policy] was implemented, not to provide a remedy to [the Browns] in this case, but instead to evade review \u000d\u000aof [the Browns\u2019] claims on the merits.\u201d \u000d\u000a3. Cross\u2013Motions for Summary Judgment\u000d\u000aOn May 31, 2012, the Browns filed a motion for summary judgment on all claims. Mr. Buhman filed a cross-motion \u000d\u000afor summary judgment.\u000d\u000aOn December 13, 2013, the district court entered a lengthy order granting the Browns\u2019 motion for summary judgment \u000d\u000aand denying Mr. Buhman\u2019s cross-motion. Brown v. Buhman, 947 F.Supp.2d 1170, 1176 (D.Utah 2013). That order \u000d\u000afirst addressed the Statute\u2019s \u201ccohabitation prong,\u201d which imposes criminal liability on a person who, \u201cknowing he has \u000d\u000aa husband or wife or knowing the other person has a husband or wife, ... cohabits with another person.\u201d Utah Code \u000d\u000aAnn. \u00a7 76\u20137\u2013101(1). The court held this portion of the Statute violated the First Amendment\u2019s Free Exercise Clause, \u000d\u000alacked a rational basis under the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process clause, and was void for vagueness. In addition, \u000d\u000athe court concluded the Browns\u2019 remaining claims\u2014those based on freedom of association, freedom of speech, equal \u000d\u000aprotection, and the Establishment Clause\u2014were at least \u201ccolorable,\u201d entitling the Browns to relief under the \u201chybrid \u000d\u000arights\u201d theory of religious free exercise. The court therefore determined the cohabitation prong had to be \u201cstricken\u201d \u000d\u000afrom the Statute. \u000d\u000aHaving struck the cohabitation prong, the court turned to the Statute\u2019s \u201cpurports to marry\u201d prong, which states, \u201cA \u000d\u000aperson is guilty of bigamy when, knowing he has a husband or wife or knowing the other person has a husband or \u000d\u000awife, the person purports to marry another person.\u201d Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76\u20137\u2013101(1). The Utah Supreme Court had \u000d\u000apreviously held that under this portion of the Statute, liability attaches when a couple hold themselves out as married, \u000d\u000aeven if they do not profess to be legally married. State v. Holm, 137 P.3d 726, 732 (Utah 2006). The district court \u000d\u000aacknowledged Holm \u2018s holding but concluded that \u201c[u]nder this broad interpretation of the term \u2018marry,\u2019 the phrase \u000d\u000a\u2018purports to marry another person\u2019 raises the same constitutional concerns addressed in relation to the cohabitation \u000d\u000aprong.\u201d Brown, 947 F.Supp.2d at 1192, 1226. It therefore adopted a \u201cnarrowing construction\u201d that interprets \u201cpurports \u000d\u000ato marry\u201d as \u201creferring to an individual\u2019s claim of entry into a legal union recognized by the state as marriage.\u201d \u000d\u000a(quoting Holm, 137 P.3d at 763 (Durham, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)). The court held that, as \u000d\u000aconstrued \u2014with the cohabitation prong stricken and the \u201cpurport to marry\u201d prong narrowed\u2014the Statute survives \u000d\u000aconstitutional scrutiny. \u000d\u000aThe district court entered judgment in favor of the Browns on December 17, 2013, but did not order injunctive relief.7\u000d\u000a4.

After ordering supplemental briefing, the district court, on August \u000d\u000a27, 2014, held that Mr. Buhman had waived qualified immunity and prosecutorial immunity defenses by failing to \u000d\u000aplead them in his answer or argue them in the summary judgment briefing. The court \u201ctherefore f[ound] in favor of \u000d\u000a[the Browns] on their seventh and final count in the Complaint under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and [granted] summary \u000d\u000ajudgment in their favor on this last remaining count.\u201d It construed the complaint to include a request for money \u000d\u000adamages but determined the Browns had \u201cdrop[ped]\u201d this request in their supplemental briefing. Accordingly, the \u000d\u000acourt awarded the Browns only \u201cattorney\u2019s fees, costs, and expenses incurred in this action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988,\u201d \u000d\u000aid. at 730, which authorizes such fees and costs in \u00a7 1983 suits.\u000d\u000aAn amended final judgment was entered the same day.

DISCUSSION\u000d\u000aMr. Buhman appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the Browns. He argues the district court erred \u000d\u000aby (1) finding a free exercise violation despite controlling precedent holding polygamy bans do not offend the Free \u000d\u000aExercise Clause, (2) concluding the Statute\u2019s prohibition of \u201creligious cohabitation\u201d lacks a rational basis under the \u000d\u000aDue Process Clause, and (3) awarding relief on the Browns\u2019 \u201chybrid rights\u201d claims.\u000d\u000aOn December 11, 2015, we ordered the parties to submit supplemental briefing addressing (1) whether the Browns \u000d\u000ahad standing at the time the complaint was filed, and (2) if so, whether the UCAO Policy rendered the Browns\u2019 claims \u000d\u000amoot.\u000d\u000aWe do not address the merits of the Browns\u2019 claims. The district court should not have done so, either. Assuming the \u000d\u000aBrowns had standing as to Mr. Buhman when they filed suit, they ceased to have standing when Mr. Buhman filed \u000d\u000ahis May 2012 declaration, and this case therefore became moot. The declaration rendered the threat of prosecution so \u000d\u000aspeculative that a live controversy no longer existed for Article III jurisdiction. We therefore remand to the district \u000d\u000acourt with directions to vacate the judgment and dismiss this case.","Chapter 3: Cohabitation and Other Unions Page 70\u000d\u000aProtecting Polyamory: Municipalities expand rights, domestic partnerships to include \u000d\u000anontraditional relationships\u000d\u000aBy: Andrew Engelson\u000d\u000aABA Journal April 27, 2023\u000d\u000aWillie Burnley Jr. sits on the city council in Somerville, Massachusetts. What he calls \u201cdoing well by his \u000d\u000acommunity\u201d looks different from the average municipal legislator voting to expand park space or increase \u000d\u000arecycling.\u000d\u000aBurnley, who is openly polyamorous, seeks to reduce discrimination for those who practice polyamory or \u000d\u000aconsensual nonmonogamy. In March, he introduced and passed through the city council three antidiscrimination bills, and expects to pass a fourth in April, focused on protecting housing and employment \u000d\u000arights for polyamorous people. They are the first such bills ever passed in the United States.\u000d\u000aBurnley was in a multipartner relationship when the city council passed a first-in-the-nation ordinance in \u000d\u000a2020 expanding domestic partnerships to include relationships with more than two people. After \u000d\u000aSomerville, two other Boston suburbs, Cambridge and Arlington, also expanded domestic partnerships to \u000d\u000apolyamorous people in 2021 and 2022, respectively.\u000d\u000a\u201cI was amazed and a little shocked,\u201d Burnley says of the milestone, which in part inspired him to run for \u000d\u000aoffice. \u201cIt was one of the proudest moments I\u2019ve had about our government.\u201d\u000d\u000aBurnley hopes his bills encourage people in nontraditional relationships to register for domestic \u000d\u000apartnerships and to be more open about their status without fear of retaliation. The expanded domestic \u000d\u000apartnerships don\u2019t feature all the legal benefits of marriage but do include hospital visitation rights and \u000d\u000ashared employment benefits.\u000d\u000aPolyamory is a slightly narrower form of consensual nonmonogamy in which people agree to have \u000d\u000amultiple, loving relationships openly and with full consent. Structure and agreements vary widely.\u000d\u000aA 2014 Chapman University study found that between 4% and 5% of people in the U.S. are involved in a \u000d\u000aconsensually nonmonogamous relationship, and a 2021 Frontiers in Psychology study estimated that that \u000d\u000aone in nine Americans have practiced it at some point in their lives.\u000d\u000aThere\u2019s little legal precedent aimed at protecting people in nontraditional relationships. But advocates are \u000d\u000againing ground at the municipal level by expanding domestic partnership laws and definitions of \u000d\u000aprotected classes. Those against this momentum say the movement weakens traditional definitions of \u000d\u000amarriage.\u000d\u000aDiana Adams, a New York family law attorney and one of the founders of the Polyamory Legal \u000d\u000aAdvocacy Coalition, believes hospital visitation rights and health insurance benefits should extend to \u000d\u000anontraditional relationships, whether it\u2019s a romantic triad or a multigenerational household raising a child.\u000d\u000a\u201cIn 2023, when the majority of American children and adults don\u2019t live in a heterosexual nuclear family,\u201d \u000d\u000aAdams says, we need laws \u201cto protect and value families as they exist, so we don\u2019t need to worry about \u000d\u000alosing our job or custody of our child because of how we build family.\u201d","Chapter 3: Cohabitation and Other Unions Page 71\u000d\u000aOf the Somerville bills passed, one expands the definition of protected class to include people in \u000d\u000arelationship structures involving multiple partners; the second and third bills amend existing antidiscrimination ordinances regarding city employment and policing to include this new protected class. A \u000d\u000afourth bill would prohibit housing discrimination based on that same protected class.\u000d\u000aThe rights of people in nontraditional relationships also got a boost in September when Judge Karen May \u000d\u000aBacdayan of the Civil Court of the City of New York, New York County, ruled in favor of petitioner \u000d\u000aMarkyus O\u2019Neill\u2014a third partner to married couple Scott Anderson and Robert Romano\u2014who sought to \u000d\u000arenew a rent-controlled apartment lease after the tenant of record, Scott Anderson, died. The wording of \u000d\u000aBacdayan\u2019s ruling in West 49th St. v. O\u2019Neill\u2014which allows the case simply to proceed\u2014might offer \u000d\u000aprecedent in other higher court cases, according to legal scholars.\u000d\u000aPolygamy vs. polyamory\u000d\u000aOften confused with polyamory, polygamy\u2014marriage between more than two people\u2014has a long, \u000d\u000acomplicated history in America, particularly among members of the Church of Latter Day Saints. \u000d\u000aTraditionally a practice that has involved men marrying multiple wives, polygamy has been prohibited \u000d\u000anationwide since 1879, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Reynolds v. U.S. that polygamy is not a \u000d\u000aconstitutionally protected religious practice.\u000d\u000aViews on the criminalization of polygamy have shifted, mostly recently in 2020, when Utah passed a law \u000d\u000areducing polygamy from a third-degree felony to an infraction subject to a fine and community service.\u000d\u000aThose supporting decriminalization say the new law encourages women in abusive polygamous marriages \u000d\u000ato report crimes without fear of prosecution.\u000d\u000a\u201cI can certainly understand how making polygamy a felony keeps some things in the dark from coming \u000d\u000aout; things that we need to deal with, particularly abuse,\u201d says Alan Hawkins, a professor and director of \u000d\u000athe School of Family Life at Brigham Young University.\u000d\u000aBut Hawkins says expanding domestic partnerships to polyamorous people threatens to trivialize the \u000d\u000ainstitution of marriage. \u201cI have real concerns about us turning a crucial social institution like marriage \u000d\u000ainto a Sunday smorgasbord,\u201d Hawkins says.\u000d\u000a\u201cWe are at risk\u2014culturally and legally\u2014of monogamy becoming a continuously negotiated agreement \u000d\u000abetween partners rather than universally understood axiom of marriage,\u201d wrote Hawkins in a Deseret \u000d\u000aNews article responding to Somerville\u2019s bills.\u000d\u000aAdams acknowledges, \u201cWhile I personally wouldn\u2019t be interested in being in the gendered polygamy that \u000d\u000awe see today, I do think that it\u2019s important that we allow people the freedom to create family as they wish, \u000d\u000aas long as everybody has informed consent.\u201d\u000d\u000aThose opposed to same-sex marriage have long made the \u201cslippery slope\u201d argument, implying that legal \u000d\u000arecognition of multipartner relationships was around the corner. In his dissenting opinion in Obergefell v. \u000d\u000aHodges, Chief Justice John Roberts speculated, \u201cWhy would there be any less dignity in the bond \u000d\u000abetween three people who, in exercising their autonomy, seek to make the profound choice to marry?\u201d\u000d\u000aAddressing similar concerns, the 2022 Respect for Marriage Act, which federally recognizes all same-sex \u000d\u000aand interracial marriages, included an amendment prohibiting polygamy or partnerships of more than two.","Chapter 3: Cohabitation and Other Unions Page 72\u000d\u000aPolyamory in practice\u000d\u000aBurnley drew inspiration from the ABA\u2019s October 2022 webinar, \u201cEmerging Legal Recognition for \u000d\u000aMulti-Partner Relationships and Families,\u201d which featured attorneys discussing issues facing their \u000d\u000apolyamorous clients.\u000d\u000aAdams, who spoke on the ABA panel and testified at Somerville\u2019s council meeting, has heard countless \u000d\u000astories of discrimination. People in the polyamorous community come to her upset about employment \u000d\u000adiscrimination, for example, \u201cand don\u2019t realize that polyamory is not protected,\u201d Adams says.\u000d\u000aFor family law attorneys defending polyamorous parents, Adams advises they focus on parenting rather \u000d\u000athan sexuality. \u201cGet, when possible, a supportive forensic psychologist to interview each of the parents \u000d\u000aand defend the family system to make it clear that your client is behaving absolutely appropriately, and \u000d\u000athat their relationship style is not in any way negative to the child,\u201d Adams says.\u000d\u000aAndy Izenson, a New York attorney and legal director of the Chosen Family Law Center, agrees, saying \u000d\u000ait\u2019s critical to draw attention to how involved a parent is, rather than their relationship status. \u201cWhich \u000d\u000aparent is actually able to attend to the child\u2019s needs? Who brings them to the pediatrician and picks them \u000d\u000aup from school?\u201d\u000d\u000aIzenson hopes courts will recognize a more expansive definition of a family member, noting that much of \u000d\u000asociety is focused on what married couples can do, whether sharing health insurance, living together or \u000d\u000araising children. \u201c[This] excludes everyone whose life has been set up in a different way,\u201d Izenson says.\u000d\u000aLegal movement\u000d\u000aThe most influential cases establishing the rights of people who practice polyamory or consensual \u000d\u000anonmonogamy, according to Boston-area attorney Kimberly Rhoten, are generally appeals court rulings \u000d\u000aoverturning parental custody rulings.\u000d\u000aA paper co-authored by Rhoten in the winter 2021 issue of Cornell Journal of Law and Public Policy \u000d\u000acounters the notion that polyamorous people are unable to meet best-interests-of-the-child standards.\u000d\u000aIt references a number of lower court cases against polyamorous parents that were reversed on appeal, \u000d\u000aincluding a 2015 case in which the Court of Appeals of Georgia (In the Interest of R. E., 333 Ga. App. 53, \u000d\u000a775 S.E.2d 542) overturned a lower court ruling that withheld a mother\u2019s custody because she was \u000d\u000apolyamorous. The appeals court found no evidence that the children were harmed by their mother\u2019s \u000d\u000apolyamory.\u000d\u000aRhoten notes that polyamorous families are just one type of legally marginalized nontraditional structure. \u000d\u000a\u201cThis includes single-parented families, multigenerational households and stepfamilies that struggle to be \u000d\u000atreated equally by the law as their married dyadic-couple counterparts.\u201d\u000d\u000aThe Uniform Law Commission\u2014a nonprofit advocacy group\u2014urges passage of the 2017 Uniform \u000d\u000aParentage Act in all 50 states, which provides an opening to redefine parent-child relationships.

Morley\u000d\u000a(citations omitted)\u000d\u000a\u00a7 4:1 International divorce planning\u000d\u000aPeople with assets and international connections who are contemplating a divorce, as well as their spouses, \u000d\u000ashould consult experienced international family law counsel for advice on strategic international divorce \u000d\u000aplanning as far in advance of filing suit as possible. The financial consequences of being divorced in one \u000d\u000ajurisdiction rather than another might be highly significant.\u000d\u000aFor example, the difference between getting divorced in London instead of in New York can be staggering. \u000d\u000aEngland has acquired a well-deserved reputation as the divorce capital of the world for anyone whose \u000d\u000aspouse is well-endowed with assets. Once the English divorce courts have finished their work, and the \u000d\u000aEnglish solicitors and barristers have collected their fees, a once-married spouse with assets will most likely \u000d\u000ahave become an ex-spouse with far less assets. Such people often wonder too late why they did not seek \u000d\u000ainternational divorce planning advice before it was too late.\u000d\u000aLikewise, the disparity between the practices of divorce courts in Tokyo as compared to those in Sydney, \u000d\u000aand of the divorce courts in Hong Kong as compared to those in Frankfurt, may be equally vast\u2014or possibly \u000d\u000aeven more so.\u000d\u000aThe difference between one divorce jurisdiction and another is far more than between a soccer team playing \u000d\u000aat home or playing away. It is often about playing one game at home and a totally different game with \u000d\u000atotally different rules away.\u000d\u000aIndeed, the analogy to a game is not inappropriate. Any serious competitor plays a competitive game \u000d\u000astrategically. Is the process of divorce any less serious than that?\u000d\u000aYet very few people do their homework on these critical issues at a time when it could really make a big \u000d\u000adifference. They simply assume that wherever they live is necessarily the jurisdiction in which they must \u000d\u000asue or be sued. They walk in blind to what may be the most significant financial transaction of their life.\u000d\u000a\u00a7 4:2 Forum selection\u000d\u000aThe very idea of shifting the law that governs the termination of a marriage is anathema to the tradition of \u000d\u000amuch of continental Europe and many other civil law jurisdictions. In such countries the traditional rule is \u000d\u000athat the marital rights of spouses should be governed by one regime, which should be fixed at the time of \u000d\u000amarriage. The system is said to be one of \u201ctotal immutability,\u201d meaning that the regime governs the parties' \u000d\u000arights throughout the marriage and is not changed even if the parties relocate to another jurisdiction. In fact, \u000d\u000atotal immutability is always something of a fiction because the same law applied in different judicial \u000d\u000asystems is likely to produce different results in practice.\u000d\u000aBy contrast, to civil law countries, in common law countries such as the United States and England, the \u000d\u000acourts generally apply the law of the forum to divorce issues. This means that if the courts in those countries ","Chapter 4: Divorce Page 75\u000d\u000ahave jurisdiction they will apply their local law to the case, regardless of the law of the place where the \u000d\u000aparties were married, where they were last living together, or their common nationality.\u000d\u000aAs people travel, set up residences in different countries, and become involved in international business \u000d\u000a(and personal) affairs they necessarily expose their personal lives to an array of different legal structures.\u000d\u000aIn some quarters, forum-shopping is a dirty term, but in international family law it is often an essential \u000d\u000aprocess. In fact, it could even be considered gross negligence if a divorce lawyer were to select the \u000d\u000aappropriate jurisdiction based on the location of the lawyer's office rather than on the best interests of the \u000d\u000aclient. If the client has the option of bringing suit in more than one jurisdiction, it is absurd to suggest that \u000d\u000athe lawyer does not have a serious obligation to consider which jurisdiction would likely yield the preferable \u000d\u000aresult.\u000d\u000a\u00a7 4:2 Forum selection\u2014Examples of appropriate forum selection\u000d\u000aSome examples of completely appropriate forum selection, drawn from the author's experiences with clients \u000d\u000aglobally, are as follows:\u000d\u000aH and W are Americans. They move to Russia (or to any one of a host of countries whose family law \u000d\u000asystems have little or no disclosure rules or are corrupt or otherwise dysfunctional) so that H can work for \u000d\u000aa major Russian finance company. He does very well financially but the marriage does not survive. W \u000d\u000adiscovers that H is cheating on her and she announces her intention to separate. H then informs her that he \u000d\u000ais no longer employed by the same company (or perhaps that his company has demoted him or the reader \u000d\u000amay imagine any one of a host of other possible stories); that he is broke; that he will divorce her in Russia; \u000d\u000athat he knows \u201chow things are done\u201d in Russia; and that she will get nothing unless she settles on his unfair \u000d\u000aterms. In these circumstances, would it be \u201cimmoral forum shopping\u201d to find a way for W to delay the \u000d\u000aRussian proceeding and to bring suit in the prior matrimonial domicile?\u000d\u000aW from New York marries H from Cyprus. They live in New York and have a young child. H then \u000d\u000asuccessfully persuades W to move to Cyprus for a year. They live with his family. W is treated badly, both \u000d\u000aemotionally and physically. H refuses to allow her to return home to New York with the child. His family \u000d\u000ais very influential in the local town and H asserts that his brother-in-law the mayor \u201cruns\u201d the court and that \u000d\u000ashe will lose custody of the child if she continues to talk back to his mother or if she does not obey him in \u000d\u000aother ways.

In such circumstances would it be \u000d\u000ainappropriate to counsel W as to ways in which she might try to shift the jurisdiction to one that would \u000d\u000aprovide her with fair treatment?\u000d\u000aA U.S. district court judge called it correctly when he insisted that \u201c[i]n reality, every litigant who files a \u000d\u000alawsuit engages in forum shopping when he chooses a place to file suit.\u201d International family lawyers work \u000d\u000ato assist their clients in that process.\u000d\u000aIn one case, a court expressly acknowledged that the plaintiff had chosen to move to the state in order to \u000d\u000abenefit from the liberal divorce laws in that state. The court found that was perfectly appropriate and did \u000d\u000anot justify a stay or dismissal of the case.\u000d\u000a\u00a7 4:13 U.S. Divorce Jurisdiction: Overview","Chapter 4: Divorce Page 76\u000d\u000aFamily lawyers in the U.S. are familiar with the rules for divorce jurisdiction that apply in their home state \u000d\u000abut an international family lawyer will frequently need to ascertain the jurisdictional rules that apply in \u000d\u000aother U.S. states also.\u000d\u000aThe impact of the U.S. Constitution on family law, and the fact that the United States is comprised of a \u000d\u000amultiplicity of jurisdictions handling family law matters, have yielded a set of jurisdictional rules that is \u000d\u000aentirely unique on the world stage.\u000d\u000aJurisdictions outside the United States typically have rules that are far more \u201call or nothing\u201d in nature, \u000d\u000ameaning that jurisdiction to grant a bare divorce implies jurisdiction to handle all of the issues that stem \u000d\u000afrom the divorce. However, U.S. courts must consider at least three separate and distinct types of \u000d\u000ajurisdiction in a typical divorce case and it is entirely possible that the courts of a particular state may have \u000d\u000ajurisdiction as to some of the issues and not have jurisdiction as to other issues.\u000d\u000aThe three categories of jurisdiction are:\u000d\u000a1. Jurisdiction to grant a bare divorce. A state has in rem jurisdiction to grant a divorce if one spouse \u000d\u000asatisfies the jurisdictional requirements of that state's statutory law even if the other spouse has no \u000d\u000aconnection with the state and is not served in the state.\u000d\u000a2. Jurisdiction to handle the financial consequences of a divorce. A state does not have jurisdiction \u000d\u000ato resolve the financial consequences of a divorce, whether these are the division of property, the \u000d\u000adetermination of child support or the determination of spousal support, unless the state has in \u000d\u000apersonam jurisdiction over the defendant by virtue of personal service instate or pursuant to the test of \u000d\u000a\u201cminimum contacts\u201d that was established by International Shoe and its progeny.\u000d\u000a3. Jurisdiction to handle child custody matters. The rules concerning child custody jurisdiction are \u000d\u000abased on factors that are entirely distinct from the factors of parental residence, domicile, and minimum \u000d\u000acontacts that form the basis of in rem and in personam divorce jurisdiction. The rules are contained in \u000d\u000athe Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction & Enforcement Act (or the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction \u000d\u000aAct in a few states) and are based on the concept of the \u201chome state\u201d of a child and a host of other very \u000d\u000aspecific rules. These issues are dealt with at length in chapter 7.\u000d\u000a\u00a7 4:14 U.S. jurisdiction to grant a bare divorce\u000d\u000aMost U.S. states have legislation that provides durational residency requirements that must \u000d\u000abe satisfied before a spouse may commence an action for divorce in the state. The periods range from six \u000d\u000aweeks in Idaho and Nevada to up to two years in New York.\u000d\u000aSome states have no durational residency rules but merely require a bona fide residency or domicile in the \u000d\u000astate. Some states expressly provide that the durational requirement must be satisfied by both residency and \u000d\u000adomicile.\u000d\u000aThere is great confusion concerning the usage of the terms \u201cresidency\u201d and \u201cdomicile\u201d in case law and \u000d\u000astatutes. The distinction is often of decisive significance in international family law cases.\u000d\u000aThe confusion stems in part from the fact that commentators frequently recite statements from the U.S. \u000d\u000aSupreme Court to the effect that a state court can exercise jurisdiction to issue a divorce if either spouse is \u000d\u000adomiciled in the state. In the Williams II case, the Supreme Court indicated that domicile was the basis of \u000d\u000adivorce jurisdiction but it has never determined whether domicile is constitutionally required, whether as a ","Chapter 4: Divorce Page 77\u000d\u000amatter of due process or otherwise. Although other courts have sometimes stated that the domicile in the \u000d\u000astate of at least one party is constitutionally required, the issue is entirely unclear. It seems that references \u000d\u000ato constitutional requirements mean little more than that state legislatures are empowered to enact \u000d\u000alegislation authorizing their courts to grant divorces in such a circumstance. In fact, however, most states \u000d\u000ahave enacted legislation that talks of residency rather than domicile.\u000d\u000aCourts also vary in the meaning they ascribe to the issue of domicile in divorce cases. Some states interpret \u000d\u000atheir statutes to require \u201cdomicile plus substantially continuous residence in the state.\u201d\u000d\u000aCourts in several states, including Alabama, Connecticut, Missouri, and New Jersey have held that the \u000d\u000astatutory requirement of residency actually means domicile, such that a plaintiff must establish that one \u000d\u000aspouse was domiciled in the state for the requisite period of time.\u000d\u000aThus, the Alabama Court of Civil Appeals has held that for the purpose of the governing statute\u2014which \u000d\u000aprovides that, \u201c[w]hen the defendant is a nonresident, the other party to the marriage must have been a bona \u000d\u000afide resident of this state for six months next before the filing of the complaint, which must be alleged in \u000d\u000athe complaint and proved\u201d\u2014residence is equivalent to domicile. Domicile is defined as residence at a \u000d\u000aparticular place accompanied by an intention to stay there permanently or for an indefinite length of time \u000d\u000aand a person's domicile continues until a new one is acquired. Accordingly, even though the Saudi Arabian \u000d\u000ahusband had lived in Alabama for nine months, his complaint was dismissed since he had failed to establish \u000d\u000athat he was domiciled in Alabama. He was a student, his visa status indicated his intention to return to Saudi \u000d\u000aArabia, and he did not allege in his divorce complaint that he intended to remain in Alabama.\u000d\u000aThe issues that arise may be illustrated by the following fairly typical fact pattern. H and W, both American \u000d\u000acitizens whose former matrimonial residence was in New York, spend several years in Japan because H has \u000d\u000abeen sent there by his employer. W wants to \u201cgo home\u201d to New York. H has amassed substantial assets in \u000d\u000ahis name as to which W has little hard data. He wants to stay in Japan.\u000d\u000aCan W bring suit in New York or must she bring the case in Japan? If she leaves Japan, must she then wait \u000d\u000afor the one or two year residency period that is apparently required by New York? Obviously her fear is \u000d\u000athat once she leaves H he will promptly file suit in Japan. The financial difference is likely to be enormous. \u000d\u000aEven though under Japan's choice of law rules a Japanese court is probably required to apply New York \u000d\u000alaw to the case, there is minimal discovery in Japan and, given the overwhelming cultural and philosophical \u000d\u000adifferences between the Japanese and American legal systems in the arena of family law, it is this author's \u000d\u000aview based on extensive experience with Japan that the Japanese courts would be most unlikely to apply \u000d\u000aNew York law in the way that a New York court would do so.\u000d\u000aNew York law provides that that state has jurisdiction if, inter alia, the parties were married in the state and \u000d\u000a\u201ceither party is a resident thereof when the action is commenced and has been a resident for a continuous \u000d\u000aperiod of one year immediately preceding.\u201d Notwithstanding the apparently clear language of the statute \u000d\u000athat requires \u201cresidence\u201d in New York, the courts have held that that term requires courts to uphold \u000d\u000ajurisdiction if the requisite period of either residency or of domicile has been established. Accordingly, \u000d\u000aastute international family law counsel might well advise W to initiate the case forthwith in New York even \u000d\u000abefore (or immediately after) she leaves Japan.\u000d\u000aOf course, if W succeeds in establishing jurisdiction based solely on her own domicile, she will have \u000d\u000asucceeded in securing so-called \u201cin rem\u201d jurisdiction only; that is, she will be able to ask the New York \u000d\u000acourt to grant a bare divorce. However, that will be essentially useless to her unless she can also establish \u000d\u000apersonal jurisdiction over H. That issue is covered in the next section.","Chapter 4: Divorce Page 78\u000d\u000aThe courts may well be prepared to treat the definition of residency or domicile more liberally if the plaintiff \u000d\u000awould otherwise need to bring suit in a foreign country. In a Texas case the plaintiff had relocated from a \u000d\u000aTexas county to Mexico several years earlier but his parents continued to live in that county, he had \u000d\u000aregistered to vote there, he had applied for and received his driver's license there, and he claimed that he \u000d\u000aconsidered the county to be his permanent residence. It was held that there was sufficient evidence to \u000d\u000asupport a trial court's finding that he had been a resident of the county in which he petitioned for divorce \u000d\u000afor at least 90 days, even though in fact he had not lived in the county for over 10 years.\u000d\u000a\u00a7 4:16 U.S. jurisdiction to handle the financial aspects of a divorce\u000d\u000aIn order for the courts of any U.S. state to have the power to determine the financial consequences of a \u000d\u000adivorce they must have personal jurisdiction over the defendant. The basic rules for obtaining personal \u000d\u000ajurisdiction in nonfamily law cases generally apply to matrimonial actions. Accordingly, a court has \u000d\u000apersonal jurisdiction over a defendant for purposes of a divorce case if:\u000d\u000a1. The defendant is served with process in any of the specified statutory ways that result in the \u000d\u000aacquisition of personal jurisdiction; or\u000d\u000a2. The defendant voluntarily appears and waives the jurisdictional objection by failing to raise it in the \u000d\u000aprescribed manner; or\u000d\u000a3. The defendant defends the action after asserting the objection to jurisdiction and the objection is not \u000d\u000aultimately sustained; or\u000d\u000a4. The defendant has had sufficient contact with the state to satisfy both state law and federal \u000d\u000aconstitutional law.\u000d\u000aState law: Jurisdiction is generally proper under state law if the provisions of the state's \u201clong arm\u201d statute \u000d\u000aare satisfied. Long-arm statutes typically end with language that authorizes jurisdiction if \u201cThere is any \u000d\u000aother basis consistent with the constitutions of this State and the United States for the exercise of personal \u000d\u000ajurisdiction.\u201d Such provisions cause the state law question to \u201ccollapse\u201d into the federal law question of \u000d\u000awhether the exercise of personal jurisdiction meets the due process requirements of the Fourteenth \u000d\u000aAmendment.\u000d\u000aCaution:\u000d\u000aHowever, because of the state-to-state variations in the language of long-arm statutes as well as judicial \u000d\u000ainterpretation of such statutes, the statutes of a particular state laws must always be scrutinized when \u000d\u000adetermining whether a prospective nonresident defendant may be brought into that state's court.\u000d\u000aFederal law: Federal law requires either:\u000d\u000a1.

Globally there are enormous variations in the grounds.\u000d\u000aAll U.S. states now have no-fault divorce, with the New York legislature having finally so provided. Many \u000d\u000astatutes contain requirements that the parties live separate and apart for a period of time before a divorce \u000d\u000abased on irreconcilable differences can be ordered.\u000d\u000aIn Northern Ireland, there is a requirement of four years marriage before a divorce, while the Republic of \u000d\u000aIreland requires four years of separation as well as the lack of any prospect of reconciliation and proof that \u000d\u000aadequate arrangements have been made for the spouse and any children.\u000d\u000aIn Malta and in the Philippines, there is no provision for divorce at all (except for Muslim divorces in the \u000d\u000aPhilippines).\u000d\u000aIn Japan, France, and Germany, divorce is allowed upon mutual consent of the parties.\u000d\u000aIn some countries, divorce is based on religious laws, as in Saudi Arabia and Israel. In India, Hindus, \u000d\u000aBuddhists, Sikhs, and Jains are governed by the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955; Christians are governed by the \u000d\u000aIndian Divorce Act, 1869; Parsis are governed by the Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act, 1936; and Muslims \u000d\u000aare governed by the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939.\u000d\u000a\u00a7 4:84. Which Law Applies: Overview \u000d\u000aMerely because a foreign court has jurisdiction to hear a divorce case does not mean that it will apply its \u000d\u000aown law to the case. A foreign court will apply its own choice of law rules to determine which substantive \u000d\u000alaw to apply to a given issue.\u000d\u000aThis concept is unfamiliar to most U.S. family lawyers since courts in the United States almost exclusively \u000d\u000aapply the law of the forum to divorce cases. That does not hold true for many foreign countries, especially \u000d\u000acivil law jurisdictions.\u000d\u000aThe countries that apply the law of the forum to family law matters, without regard to the extent to which \u000d\u000athe parties are connected to the forum, are primarily those jurisdictions with historical connections to \u000d\u000aEngland. They include Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Ireland, New Zealand, Singapore, and the United \u000d\u000aStates, as well as the three United Kingdom jurisdictions.\u000d\u000aThose countries that apply choice of law rules to family law matters generally apply a scale of connecting \u000d\u000afactors in order to establish the \u201cclosest connection\u201d between the spouses and the applicable law. Priority \u000d\u000ais typically given to the spouses\u2019 common nationality or the last common nationality if one spouse still \u000d\u000aretains it. If the nationality test is not satisfied the divorce is typically subject to the law of the common \u000d\u000ahabitual residence of the spouses, followed by the law of the spouses\u2019 last common habitual residence if \u000d\u000aone of them still lives there.\u000d\u000aSome European civil law countries, such as Austria, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, and Spain, allow \u000d\u000athe divorcing parties to select the law that will govern their divorce case, provided the selected jurisdiction \u000d\u000ahas a designated type of connection to one or both parties.","Chapter 4: Divorce Page 80\u000d\u000aCaution:\u000d\u000aPractitioners need to be alert to the possibility that a local court will refuse to apply the designated foreign \u000d\u000alaw in any particular case. Such a refusal could be based on the public policy exception that often applies \u000d\u000awhenever legislation requires the application of foreign law. For example, the Greek Civil Code has detailed \u000d\u000arules concerning the applicability of foreign law, but those rules include an exception based on public \u000d\u000apolicy. In the author\u2019s experience, Greek judges are not reluctant to apply the exception in order to protect \u000d\u000aa Greek citizen.\u000d\u000a\u00a7 4:85. Reasons why a court may apply the law of another country\u000d\u000aWhen a court applies the law of another country in a divorce case, it theoretically produces the same \u000d\u000aresult that would be reached if the case were brought in the other country courts. In reality, this is pure \u000d\u000afiction. The reasons for this include:\u000d\u000a\u2022 Judges and practitioners in the forum state may be entirely unfamiliar with the foreign legal \u000d\u000asystem. There may be no realistic way for them to overcome that barrier since laws cannot be \u000d\u000aunderstood separately from the society and legal culture to which they belong.\u000d\u000a\u2022 Applying foreign law often entails the exercise of significant discretion, particularly in the case \u000d\u000aof child custody and financial matters. Local traditions about child-rearing might be difficult for a \u000d\u000ajudge to overcome. Local economic conditions will doubtless color awards of child and spousal \u000d\u000asupport and the division of marital property. This is most particularly the case when a court in a \u000d\u000acivil law jurisdiction is asked to apply the law of countries such as Australia, England, and \u000d\u000aSingapore, where judicial discretion is enormous and its potential for abuse is restrained by \u000d\u000aprecedent and judicial commonsense that has been nurtured in a particular culture.\u000d\u000a\u2022 Foreign laws may be distasteful to judges in a particular forum. Judges who are accustomed to \u000d\u000abeing especially protective of the rights of the less-advantaged will struggle to apply laws that tend \u000d\u000ato protect the more powerful party, and vice versa. Judges in a environment in which fault forms \u000d\u000athe basis of divorce law may resent being expected to ignore such issues in a specific case. Judges \u000d\u000ain a religiously based legal system might refuse to apply a secular legal system.\u000d\u000a\u2022 There may well be entirely different procedures in the foreign country to value marital assets \u000d\u000asuch as an interest in a business.\u000d\u000a\u2022 There will often be substantial differences in financial disclosure requirements, which the forum \u000d\u000acourt will not deem a part of the foreign substantive law that it will need to apply.\u000d\u000a\u2022 Expert evidence may be needed to explain the foreign laws. Such evidence might be expensive \u000d\u000ato secure and time-consuming to implement.\u000d\u000a\u00a7 4:86. U.S. choice of law issues\u000d\u000aCourts in the U.S. almost always apply the law of the forum to matters concerning divorce, even including \u000d\u000athe division of real and personal property (or at least to dividing the value of such assets) upon a divorce. \u000d\u000aThis approach has persisted even in the face of the \u201cchoice of law revolution\u201d that has led American courts \u000d\u000ain almost every other area of the law to favor and apply the law of the state with the \u201cmost significant \u000d\u000arelationship\u201d to the matter.","Chapter 4: Divorce Page 81\u000d\u000aIn the area of family law, American legislatures and courts have preferred to limit inappropriate jurisdictionhopping and competing sprints to the courthouses of different states by relying on jurisdictional residency \u000d\u000aand domicile rules, as well as discretionary stays under the forum non conveniens doctrine. Relying on \u000d\u000adurational residency requirements may be somewhat misplaced in that a few weeks in Nevada will suffice, \u000d\u000aas will a few days in Guam, or overnight in Alaska, Washington,1 or South Dakota as long as the intention \u000d\u000ais to stay there long-term.\u000d\u000aCase law in some states, primarily community property states, supports the proposition that the status of \u000d\u000aproperty for purposes of divorce should not necessarily be determined by the law of the forum. However, \u000d\u000aeven in community property states, some statutes provide that upon divorce the forum court may divide any \u000d\u000aproperty acquired out of state which would have been community property if acquired within the state. \u000d\u000aWhile there are cases in which courts in community property states have asserted that they may apply the \u000d\u000alaw of another state or country to assets acquired while the parties lived there, the number of cases in which \u000d\u000aa foreign law is actually applied is extremely small. The reason is that U.S. courts and legislatures have \u000d\u000apreferred to have the consequences of a divorce handled in one court pursuant to a uniform approach rather \u000d\u000athan piecemeal. Nonetheless the issue should be analyzed whenever a divorce case may be heard in such a \u000d\u000astate and property was acquired in another state or country.\u000d\u000aEquitable distribution states apply only their own law to the division of property, regardless of where the \u000d\u000aproperty is located. Equitable distribution requires a \u201cbig picture\u201d analysis of what is fair in the \u000d\u000acircumstances, which would be difficult if not impossible to manage if the courts were required to consider \u000d\u000adifferent items of property in different ways.\u000d\u000aThus, a Kentucky court with personal and subject matter jurisdiction in a husband\u2019s divorce proceeding had \u000d\u000athe power to declare the interests of each spouse in a villa and a mini-storage warehouse business located \u000d\u000ain the Netherlands Antilles. Of course, enforcement of the decree to transfer title in the properties would \u000d\u000arequire a separate action in the overseas jurisdiction where the properties were located. \u000d\u000aLikewise, a Washington state trial court\u2019s personal jurisdiction over the spouses and subject matter \u000d\u000ajurisdiction over the marital dissolution action was held on appeal to include the power to distribute the \u000d\u000aspouses\u2019 personal interests in real estate located in Poland. The court ruled that the subject matter of the \u000d\u000adissolution action was not an action to settle title to real estate. It was not an in rem action over property in \u000d\u000aPoland. Rather, it was an in personam action in which a Washington court had jurisdiction to determine the \u000d\u000aparties\u2019 relative interests in all property brought to the court\u2019s attention. \u000d\u000aAn important exception to the rule that courts apply the law of the forum in divorce cases is that courts in \u000d\u000athe United States will apply foreign law to interpret prenuptial and postnuptial agreements when the state\u2019s \u000d\u000aconflict of law rules require\u000d\u000a\u00a7 4:87.

Bertelsmann J in Thembisile and Another v \u000d\u000aThembisile and Another 2002 (2) SA 209 (T) at para 28 acknowledged the importance of this question when he \u000d\u000aheld:\u000d\u000a\u2018It appears to be well established, however, that \u201cin customary law the central issue in divorce proceedings is \u000d\u000arefund of bridewealth, an obligation taken so literally that the husband could demand return of the same cattle \u000d\u000ahe had originally given. If they had died in the interim, the defendant could settle the claim with a cash\u000d\u000aequivalent\u201d\u2019.\u000d\u000aIt is worth noting that the RCMA does not specifically make the tendering of ilobolo a requirement for the \u000d\u000aconclusion of a valid customary marriage. Section 8 is instructive in providing that a customary marriage is to \u000d\u000abe dissolved by a decree of divorce granted by a competent court. As of necessity, this provision means that a \u000d\u000acustomary marriage is to be dissolved like a civil marriage and that the provisions of the Divorce Act 70 of 1979 \u000d\u000awill apply. Although an argument can be made that, in omitting the tendering of ilobolo from the general \u000d\u000arequirements for the validity of a customary marriage, the legislature watered down the role and the significance \u000d\u000aof ilobolo in the conclusion of a customary marriage.\u000d\u000aAcademics and courts have interpreted s 3(1)(b) of the RCMA as a tacit requirement that ilobolo must be given \u000d\u000ain order for the customary marriage to be valid, or at the very least, so goes the argument, there must be \u000d\u000anegotiations and agreement concerning payment, in part or in full, of ilobolo (see L Mofokeng \u2018The lobolo \u000d\u000aagreement as the \u201csilent\u201d prerequisite for the validity of a customary marriage in terms of the Recognition of \u000d\u000aCustomary Marriages Act\u2019 (2005) 68 THRHR 277 at 278). In Maloba v Dube and Others (GSJ) (unreported case \u000d\u000ano 08/3077, 23-6-2008) (Mokgoatlheng J) the court held that \u2018[t]he agreement to marry in customary law is \u000d\u000apredicated upon lobolo in its various manifestations. The agreement to pay lobolo underpins the customary \u000d\u000amarriage\u2019 (at para 26).","Chapter 4: Divorce Page 83\u000d\u000aNotwithstanding the RCMA\u2019s silence on ilobolo as a requirement for a valid customary marriage, there is clear \u000d\u000aunderstanding of the importance of ilobolo from those who practice customary law and the courts. This \u000d\u000aimportance has recently been underlined in Southon v Moropane (GSJ) (unreported case no 14295/10, 18-7-\u000d\u000a2012) (Saldulker J) where the court held that \u2018[t]he traditional principle that there can be no [valid] customary \u000d\u000amarriage without lobolo being delivered or at least negotiated, still prevails\u2019 (at para 81).\u000d\u000aI submit that the delivery of, or the negotiation of ilobolo pursuant to the conclusion of a customary marriage is \u000d\u000athe most important ingredient that distinguishes a customary marriage from other forms of marriages. It is the \u000d\u000aingredient that differentiates a customary marriage from mere cohabitation, popularly known as vat en sit. JC \u000d\u000aBekker correctly argues that \u2018[l]obolo is therefore the rock on which the customary marriage is founded; there \u000d\u000ais considerable justification for the view that a lobolo contract has a greater binding force than a marriage at \u000d\u000acommon law\u2019 (JC Bekker Seymour\u2019s Customary Law in Southern Africa 5ed (Cape Town: Juta 1989) at 151).\u000d\u000aFunction and significance of ilobolo\u000d\u000aThere are diverse opinions concerning the function and significance of ilobolo, especially among feminists and \u000d\u000athose who do not practise customary law. At the heart of these divergent views is the misconception of ilobolo \u000d\u000aas a purchase-and-sale transaction. To some extent many still hold this misconception. This is probably one of \u000d\u000athe reasons why the legislature decided not to make the tendering and receiving of ilobolo a requirement for the \u000d\u000aconclusion of a customary marriage.\u000d\u000aAdherents of customary law and practices are themselves not united as to the exact function and significance of \u000d\u000ailobolo, let alone the retention and/or refund of it on divorce. Some have said that the function and significance \u000d\u000aof ilobolo properly analysed have to do with the transfer of the reproductive capacity of the woman from her \u000d\u000afamily into that of her husband (NJJ Olivier; JC Bekker; NJJ Olivier (Jnr) and WH Olivier Indigenous Law \u000d\u000a(Durban: LexisNexis 1995) at 32). Viewed in this way, it can be said that ilobolo plays a legitimising function \u000d\u000afor the children born of the customary marriage. Some hold a view that ilobolo is a token of appreciation that \u000d\u000athe groom\u2019s family extend to the bride\u2019s family for rearing the bride and that it is only once ilobolo or part of it \u000d\u000ahas been tendered and received that the bride is welcomed by the ancestors of the groom into the family. In \u000d\u000acapturing these divergent views on the function and significance of ilobolo, RM Dlamini argues that ilobolo in \u000d\u000aits proper customary sense has a multiplicity of legal functions (RM Dlamini \u2018The transformation of a customary \u000d\u000amarriage in Zulu Law\u2019 1983 CILSA 383 at 386).\u000d\u000aHe opined as follows: \u2018Its ceremonial transfer from the husband\u2019s to the wife\u2019s group is a public record and \u000d\u000aexpression of the creation of a new matrimonial relationship; it is of probative value and is a validating act by \u000d\u000awhich a customary marriage is concluded; it marks the formal creation of the marital power of the husband over \u000d\u000ahis wife and gives him exclusive access to his wife, thus making it adulterous for another [woman] to have \u000d\u000arelations with [him]; it also gives the husband parental power over children born of his wife and assures their \u000d\u000aaffiliation to him.\u2019\u000d\u000aWhatever the true function and significance of ilobolo is, it is clear that its tender or, at the very least, its \u000d\u000anegotiation is a bedrock on which a customary marriage rests. So important is ilobolo that some have argued it \u000d\u000aprovides stability to the customary marriage. In the words of Dlamini (op cit 390) the prospect of forfeiture of \u000d\u000ailobolo was thought to deter a man from divorcing his wife frivolously, and on the other hand, the possible return \u000d\u000aof ilobolo by the wife\u2019s father should she misbehave motivated her to behave with due decorum and not to wreck \u000d\u000athe marriage by her misconduct.\u000d\u000aDissolution of a customary marriage\u000d\u000aSection 8 of the RCMA purports to dissolve a customary marriage in the exact terms the Divorce Act dissolves a \u000d\u000acivil marriage. An anomaly in this is that the very nature of a customary marriage is distinct from a civil marriage. \u000d\u000aThis fact was captured in the Gumede case (at para 18) where it was held: \u2018In our pre-colonial past, [customary] ","Chapter 4: Divorce Page 84\u000d\u000amarriage was always a bond between families and not individual spouses. Whilst the two parties to the marriage \u000d\u000awere not unimportant, their marriage relationship had a collective or communal substance. Procreation and \u000d\u000asurvival were important goals of this type of marriage and indispensable for the well-being of a larger group.\u2019\u000d\u000aIt therefore follows that the provisions of an Act that was enacted to dissolve a marriage that is based on \u000d\u000aindividualistic principles like a civil marriage cannot properly apply to a marriage that has a collective or a \u000d\u000a\u2018communal substance\u2019. A customary marriage is not purely a matter between the bride and the bridegroom, it is \u000d\u000aalso \u2018a group concern, legalising a relationship between two groups of relatives\u2019 (see Mabena v Letsoalo 1998 \u000d\u000a(2) SA 1068 (T) at 1072C \u2013 D).\u000d\u000aPrior to the RCMA, a customary marriage could be dissolved by the death of the husband provided the woman \u000d\u000awas not transferred to one of the brothers of the deceased to sire an heir (M Herbst and W du Plessis \u2018Customary \u000d\u000aLaw v Common Law Marriages: A Hybrid Approach in South Africa\u2019 vol 12.1 (2008) EJCL at 11) \u000d\u000a(www.ejcl.org/121/art121-28.pdf, accessed 3-10-2013). This practice, provided the woman accepted, was \u000d\u000acalled ukungenwa. During the lifetime of the husband, owing to ill-treatment or any other valid reason, a woman \u000d\u000acould return to her father\u2019s household thereby forcing her husband to phuthuma (fetch) her with a fine, failing \u000d\u000awhich, it was accepted that the husband did not want to continue with the marriage (Herbst and Du Plessis op \u000d\u000acit at 11). These flexible and practical rules developed over time to constitute grounds for dissolution of a \u000d\u000acustomary marriage, something the RCMA has taken away in insisting that a customary marriage may be \u000d\u000adissolved only by a court ordering a decree of divorce.\u000d\u000aThe established rules in relation to the retention and refund of ilobolo were that ilobolo or a portion of it could \u000d\u000abe refunded under certain circumstances, including\u000d\u000a\u2022 where a wife deserted her husband and refused to return when fetched; or\u000d\u000a\u2022 was guilty of conduct giving rise to him rejecting her; or\u000d\u000a\u2022 her father repaid it in an apparent act of dissolving the marriage (Bekker op cit at 150 \u2013 151).\u000d\u000aBut where a husband rejected his wife without cause ilobolo could be retained (Bekker op cit at 151).\u000d\u000aThe RCMA is as silent on the retention and repayment of ilobolo as it is on the necessity of delivering it at the \u000d\u000aconclusion of a customary marriage. This is notwithstanding the fact that old authorities on the matter are \u000d\u000aunanimous that ilobolo could be retained and refunded depending on the circumstances leading to the divorce \u000d\u000a(see Sila v Masuku1937 NAC (N & T) 121; Matlala v Tompa 1951 NAC (N-E) 404). I submit that at the time \u000d\u000awhen ilobolo carries both a cultural significance and economic value and at the time when divorces are so \u000d\u000afrequent, it is foreseeable that spouses are going to quarrel over its retention and refund more than ever before. \u000d\u000aWhen they do, it is not hard to imagine that courts would once again fashion creative ways within the RCMA \u000d\u000aand the Divorce Act, which creative ways may very well supplement the apparent shortcomings of the RCMA. \u000d\u000aAfter all \u2018customary law is a flexible, living system of law, which develops over time to meet the changing needs \u000d\u000aof the community\u2019 (see Shilubana and Others v Nwamitwa and Others [2008] ZACC 9; 2008 (9) BCLR \u000d\u000a914 (CC) at para 35).\u000d\u000aPerhaps one of the creative ways would be for the courts to fashion a solution that looks like a forfeiture of \u000d\u000abenefits under s 9(1) of the Divorce Act. Should this be the case, courts, when determining whether to order \u000d\u000aretention or a refund of ilobolo or a part thereof, would be entitled to take into account factors like the duration \u000d\u000aof the customary marriage, the circumstances giving rise to the breakdown, and any substantial misconduct on \u000d\u000athe part of either of the parties. In this formulation the principal reason for the retention or a refund of ilobolo will \u000d\u000abe the undue benefit that may arise if such an order of repayment is not made.\u000d\u000aConclusion\u000d\u000aNotwithstanding the muteness of the RCMA on issues pertaining to the tender and retention of ilobolo, the courts \u000d\u000aare no strangers to these disputes. In Nkambule v Linda 1951 (1) SA 377 (A) at 384D the court held that a \u000d\u000awoman in a customary marriage is justified to leave a man who has contracted a civil marriage and, in so doing, ","Chapter 4: Divorce Page 85\u000d\u000adoes not render her guardian liable for a refund of ilobolo. The Nkambule judgment has recently been confirmed \u000d\u000aby the Supreme Court of Appeal in Netshituka v Netshituka and Others 2011 (5) SA 453 (SCA). It can therefore \u000d\u000abe concluded that a claim for a refund of ilobolo, despite it not being provided for either in the RCMA or the \u000d\u000aDivorce Act, remains a competent claim at customary law, which claim could be enforceable against the \u000d\u000acustomary law wife or her guardian or both of them.","Chapter 5: Children Page 86\u000d\u000aSECTION 5.1: THE HAGUE CONVENTION ON INTERNATIONAL ADOPTION AND \u000d\u000aSELECTED ARTICLES\u000d\u000aUnderstanding the Hague Convention on Adoption\u000d\u000aBy: Bureau of Consular Affairs; U.S. Department of State\u000d\u000ahttp://travel.state.gov/content/adoptionsabroad/en/hague-convention/understanding-the-hague-convention.html\u000d\u000aThe Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption \u000d\u000a(Convention) is an international agreement to safeguard intercountry adoptions.

It expanded slowly after World War II, until \u000d\u000athe 1970s, when the numbers increased considerably. By the 1980s, it was recognized that this phenomenon was \u000d\u000acreating serious and complex human and legal problems and the absence of existing domestic and international \u000d\u000alegal instruments indicated the need for a multilateral approach.1 It was in this context that the Hague Convention \u000d\u000aof 29 May 1993 on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption (\u201c1993 Hague \u000d\u000aConvention\u201d or \u201cConvention\u201d) was developed to establish safeguards which ensure that intercountry adoptions \u000d\u000atake place in the best interests of the child and with respect for the child\u2019s fundamental rights. \u000d\u000aThe Convention recognizes that growing up in a family is of primary importance and is essential for the \u000d\u000ahappiness and healthy development of the child. It also recognizes that intercountry adoption may offer the \u000d\u000aadvantage of a permanent family to a child for whom a suitable family cannot be found in his or her country of \u000d\u000aorigin. By setting out clear procedures and prohibiting improper financial gain, the Convention provides greater \u000d\u000asecurity, predictability and transparency for all parties to the adoption, including prospective adoptive parents. \u000d\u000aThe Convention also establishes a system of co-operation between authorities in countries of origin and receiving \u000d\u000acountries, designed to ensure that intercountry adoption takes place under conditions which help to guarantee \u000d\u000athe best adoption practices and elimination of abuses. \u000d\u000aThe 1993 Hague Convention gives effect to Article 21 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights \u000d\u000aof the Child2 by adding substantive safeguards and procedures to the broad principles and norms laid down in\u000d\u000athe Convention on the Rights of the Child. The 1993 Convention establishes minimum standards, but does not \u000d\u000aintend to serve as a uniform law of adoption. While making the rights and interests of the child paramount, it \u000d\u000aalso respects and protects the rights of families of origin and adoptive families.\u000d\u000aThe Convention makes clear that receiving States and States of origin must share the burdens and \u000d\u000abenefits of regulating intercountry adoptions. It sets out clearly which functions within the adoption process are \u000d\u000ato be performed by each State.\u000d\u000aPrincipal features of the Convention\u000d\u000aThe best interests of the child are paramount\u000d\u000aThe Convention contains certain rules to ensure that adoptions take place in the best interests of the child and \u000d\u000awith respect for his or her fundamental rights. For example, States must: consider national solutions first \u000d\u000a(implement the principle of subsidiarity); ensure the child is adoptable; preserve information about the child and \u000d\u000ahis / her parents; evaluate thoroughly the prospective adoptive parents; match the child with a suitable family; \u000d\u000aimpose additional safeguards where needed.\u000d\u000aThis fundamental principle of the child's best interests should guide the development of an integrated \u000d\u000anational child care and protection system. If intercountry adoption is needed as part of such a national child \u000d\u000acare system, it must be ethical and child-centered.\u000d\u000aSubsidiarity principle","Chapter 5: Children Page 88\u000d\u000a\u201cSubsidiarity\u201d in the Convention means that Contracting States recognize that a child should be raised by his or \u000d\u000aher birth family or extended family whenever possible. If that is not possible or practicable, other forms of \u000d\u000apermanent care in the State of origin should be considered. Only after due consideration has been given to \u000d\u000anational solutions should intercountry adoption be considered, and then only if it is in the child\u2019s best interests. \u000d\u000aAs a general rule, institutional care should be considered as a last resort for a child in need of a family. \u000d\u000aSafeguards to protect children from abduction, sale and trafficking\u000d\u000aStates should establish safeguards to prevent abduction, sale and trafficking in children for adoption by: \u000d\u000aprotecting birth families from exploitation and undue pressure; ensuring only children in need of a family are \u000d\u000aadoptable and adopted; preventing improper financial gain and corruption; regulating agencies and individuals \u000d\u000ainvolved in adoptions by accrediting them in accordance with Convention standards. \u000d\u000aCo-operation between States and within States\u000d\u000aThe Convention envisages a system in which all Contracting States work together to ensure the protection of \u000d\u000achildren. Co-operation between Contracting States is essential to ensure the effectiveness of any safeguards put \u000d\u000ain place (Art. 1 b)). In practice, this principle is implemented first through international co-operation between \u000d\u000aCentral Authorities, and between other public authorities and accredited bodies performing the functions of \u000d\u000aCentral Authorities (Art. 7); second, through intra-State co-operation between authorities and agencies regarding \u000d\u000aConvention procedures (Art. 7(1)); and third, through co-operation to prevent abuses and avoidance of the \u000d\u000aConvention (Art. 33). \u000d\u000aAutomatic recognition of adoption decisions\u000d\u000aThe 1993 Hague Convention achieved a major breakthrough in establishing a system of automatic recognition \u000d\u000aof adoptions made in accordance with the Convention. Every adoption, whether a simple or full adoption, which \u000d\u000ais certified to be made in accordance with Convention procedures, is recognized \u201cby operation of law\u201d in all \u000d\u000aother Contracting States (Art. 23). In other words, the Convention gives immediate certainty to the status of the \u000d\u000achild, and eliminates the need for a procedure for recognition of orders, or re-adoption, in the receiving State. \u000d\u000aCompetent authorities, Central Authorities and accredited bodies\u000d\u000aThe Convention requires that only competent authorities should perform Convention functions. Competent \u000d\u000aauthorities may be Central Authorities, public authorities, including judicial or administrative authorities, and \u000d\u000aaccredited bodies. The Convention provides for a system of Central Authorities in all Contracting States and \u000d\u000aimposes certain general obligations on them, such as: co-operation with one another through the exchange of \u000d\u000ageneral information concerning intercountry adoption; the elimination of any obstacles to the application of the \u000d\u000aConvention (Art. 7(2) b)); and a responsibility to deter all practices contrary to the objects of the Convention \u000d\u000a(Art. 8). Central Authorities also have specific obligations under Chapter IV in respect of individual adoptions. \u000d\u000aAccredited bodies may perform some of the functions of Central Authorities. The process of accreditation of \u000d\u000abodies is one of the Convention\u2019s safeguards to protect children in adoption. Any private adoption body or \u000d\u000aagency must be accountable to a supervising or accrediting authority (see Arts 6-13).

If \u000d\u000aaccredited bodies are to be used, the Convention sets out a regulatory framework of minimum standards for their \u000d\u000aoperation in Articles 10, 11 and 32.

This second Guide under the 1993 Hague Convention emphasizes that the principles \u000d\u000aand obligations of the Convention apply to all actors in Hague Convention intercountry adoptions; clarifies the \u000d\u000aConvention obligations and standards for the establishment and operation of accredited bodies; encourages \u000d\u000aacceptance of higher standards than the minimum standards of the Convention; identifies good practices to \u000d\u000aimplement those obligations and standards; and proposes a set of model accreditation criteria which will assist \u000d\u000aContracting States to achieve greater consistency in the professional standards and practices of their accredited \u000d\u000abodies. \u000d\u000aThe Intercountry Adoption Technical Assistance Program (ICATAP)\u000d\u000aThe Permanent Bureau has, for many years, undertaken the review and monitoring of the 1993 Hague \u000d\u000aConvention\u2019s practical operation, including promotional activities, and has also regularly provided advice and \u000d\u000asupport to requesting countries on a wide range of issues related to general implementation and operation of the \u000d\u000aConvention.\u000d\u000aIn order for the Convention to operate successfully, the initial steps necessary for its effective implementation \u000d\u000ain each Contracting State must be carefully planned. The Convention places heavy burdens of responsibility on \u000d\u000aStates, and implementation and technical assistance may be particularly vital in some countries that have few \u000d\u000aresources available for this purpose. Therefore, more recently, the Permanent Bureau has provided, on request, \u000d\u000amore extensive technical assistance to targeted States specifically related to the implementation and application \u000d\u000aof the Convention. \u000d\u000aICATAP was designed to provide assistance directly to the governments of certain States which are planning \u000d\u000aratification of, or accession to, the Convention, or which have ratified or acceded but are experiencing difficulties \u000d\u000awith implementation of the Convention. \u000d\u000aSubject to the availability of funding, ICATAP is operated directly by the Permanent Bureau, as well as in cooperation with international consultants and experts, and international organizations such as UNICEF. The \u000d\u000aHague approach takes full account of the need to integrate the intercountry adoption process within the broader \u000d\u000achild care and protection system. Technical assistance may include: \u000d\u000a- assistance in developing and in reviewing implementation legislation and regulations; \u000d\u000a- providing advice on the creation and functions of Central Authorities and other competent authorities; \u000d\u000a- providing training and other operational assistance to authorities and other relevant actors;\u000d\u000a- help in developing the tools to achieve the above activities, by means of diagnostic visits, the use of \u000d\u000aexternal consultants, partnerships with other organizations, etc;\u000d\u000a- providing judges with relevant training, information and opportunities for informal exchanges; and\u000d\u000a- providing information and advice to States considering ratification or accession to assist their decision \u000d\u000amaking and other factors relevant to effective implementation.

The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) on Wednesday registered \u000d\u000acomplaints filed by four American families challenging the so-called Dima Yakovlev law, which prohibits US \u000d\u000afamilies from adopting Russian orphans, attorney Karinna Moskalenko told RAPSI.\u000d\u000aThe law prohibits US citizens from adopting Russian children and provides for the termination of the \u000d\u000aUS/Russia adoption Agreement signed by both countries in 2011. In signing the bill into law, Russian \u000d\u000aPresident Vladimir Putin issued a decree aimed at improving conditions for Russian orphans. The multifaceted \u000d\u000adecree took aim at a number of overarching policy goals and called for the establishment of perks for Russian \u000d\u000aadoptive parents.\u000d\u000aOn January 22, the Supreme Court held that of the adoptions pending at the time the Dima Yakovlev law took \u000d\u000aeffect, those that had already received court approval would go through. According to a statement on its \u000d\u000awebsite: \"Children whose adoptions by US nationals were approved by courts before January 1, 2013, and \u000d\u000ahave come into force, including after January 1, 2013, must be turned over to their adoptive parents.\"\u000d\u000aAccording to Moskalenko, the complaint was filed on January 22 by four families who had not yet received \u000d\u000acourt orders permitting their pending adoptions of Russian orphans when the law entered into force.\u000d\u000aIn Moskalenko\u2019s view, the law\u2019s enactment was repugnant to the minimum requirements required by the \u000d\u000aEuropean Convention on Human Rights (Convention). She specifically raises claims under articles 3 \u2013 which \u000d\u000aprohibits torture, 8 \u2013 which provides for protection of one\u2019s private and family life, and 14 \u2013 which protects \u000d\u000aagainst discrimination.\u000d\u000aThe claimants don\u2019t only want the breaches that they assert they suffered personally to be fixed; they urge the \u000d\u000aenactment of amendments to the law.\u000d\u000aThey further argue that Russia lacks an effective mechanism to allow them to launch an appeal. As a result, the \u000d\u000afamilies further assert a violation of Article 13 of the Convention, which protects the right to effective remedy.\u000d\u000aThe law is unofficially named for Dima Yakovlev, a two-year-old Russian boy who died after his adoptive \u000d\u000aAmerican father left him in the car for nine hours on a hot summer day.","Chapter 5: Children Page 91\u000d\u000aEuropean Court Rules Russian Ban on U.S. Adoptions Violated Rights\u000d\u000ahttps://www.rferl.org/a/russia-european-court-adoption-ban-violated-rights/28239120.html\u000d\u000aJanuary 17, 2017\u000d\u000aThe European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has ruled that a Russian law barring Americans from adopting \u000d\u000aRussian children led to human rights violations.\u000d\u000aThe ruling posted on the Strasbourg court's website on January 17 said that the legislation, which President \u000d\u000aVladimir Putin signed in December 2012, resulted in breaches of articles of the European Convention on Human \u000d\u000aRights that prohibit discrimination and guarantee the right to respect for family life.\u000d\u000aThe court found that the ban illegally discriminated against prospective American parents of Russian-born \u000d\u000achildren because it prevented their adoption \"purely on the basis of the prospective parents' nationality,\" the \u000d\u000aECHR said in a statement.\u000d\u000aIt also said the ban was \"disproportionate to the [Russian] government's stated aims, given that it had been \u000d\u000aretroactive, indiscriminate, and was applied irrespective of the status of proceedings or the individual \u000d\u000acircumstances.\"\u000d\u000aThe complaint was filed by 45 U.S. citizens on behalf of themselves and the 27 Russian children they were in \u000d\u000athe final stages of adopting when the law took effect. The prospective parents said that \"a bond had already \u000d\u000aformed between the adults and children\" and that the ban \"violated their right to family life,\" the court said.\u000d\u000aThe ECHR obliged Russia to pay the prospective parents a combined sum of 75,000 euros ($80,000) in \u000d\u000acompensation and 13,600 euros ($14,400) for expenses.\u000d\u000aRussia plans to appeal the ruling, Moscow's representative to the court, Deputy Justice Minister Georgy \u000d\u000aMatyushkin, told Ekho Moskvy radio.\u000d\u000aPutin signed the so-called Dima Yakovlev Law in retaliation to a U.S. law imposing asset freezes and travel bans \u000d\u000aon Russians accused by the United States of human rights abuses, including those believed involved in the death \u000d\u000aof whistle-blower Sergei Magnitsky in a Moscow jail in 2009.\u000d\u000aIt contributed to a deterioration of Russian-U.S. ties that began around the time Putin revealed plans to return to \u000d\u000athe Kremlin in 2012 and accelerated after Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine in March 2014.","Chapter 5: Children Page 92\u000d\u000aSECTION 5.2: THE HAGUE CONVENTION ON INTERNATIONAL CHILD ABDUCTION \u000d\u000aAND SELECTED ARTICLES\u000d\u000aOutline: Hague Child Abduction Convention\u000d\u000aBy: Hague Conference on Private International Law (HCHH)\u000d\u000ahttps://www.hcch.net/en/instruments/conventions/specialised-sections/child-abduction\u000d\u000aIntroduction\u000d\u000aAlthough international child abduction is not a new problem, the incidence of such abductions continue to \u000d\u000agrow with the ease of international travel, the increase in bi-cultural marriages and the rise in the divorce rate. \u000d\u000aInternational child abductions have serious consequences for both the child and the left-behind parent. The \u000d\u000achild is removed, not only from contact with the other parent, but also from his or her home environment and \u000d\u000atransplanted to a culture with which he or she may have had no prior ties. International abductors move the \u000d\u000achild to another State with a different legal system, social structure, culture and, often, language. These \u000d\u000adifferences, plus the physical distance generally involved, can make locating, recovering and returning \u000d\u000ainternationally abducted children complex and problematic.\u000d\u000aThe Convention of 25 October 1980 on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction seeks to combat \u000d\u000aparental child abduction by providing a system of co-operation between Central Authorities and a rapid \u000d\u000aprocedure for the return of the child to the country of the child\u2019s habitual residence.\u000d\u000aThe return mechanism\u000d\u000aThe principal object of the Convention, aside from protecting rights of access, is to protect children from the \u000d\u000aharmful effects of cross-border abductions (and wrongful retentions) by providing a procedure designed to \u000d\u000abring about the prompt return of such children to the State of their habitual residence. The Convention is based \u000d\u000aon a presumption that, save in exceptional circumstances, the wrongful removal or retention of a child across \u000d\u000ainternational boundaries is not in the interests of the child, and that the return of the child to the State of the \u000d\u000ahabitual residence will promote his or her interests by vindicating the right of the child to have contact with \u000d\u000aboth parents, by supporting continuity in the child's life, and by ensuring that any determination of the issue of \u000d\u000acustody or access is made by the most appropriate court having regard to the likely availability of relevant \u000d\u000aevidence. The principle of prompt return also serves as a deterrent to abductions and wrongful removals, and \u000d\u000athis is seen by the Convention to be in the interests of children generally. The return order is designed to \u000d\u000arestore the status quo which existed before the wrongful removal or protection, and to deprive the wrongful \u000d\u000aparent of any advantage that might otherwise be gained by the abduction.\u000d\u000aA return order is not a custody determination. It is simply an order that the child be returned to the jurisdiction \u000d\u000awhich is most appropriate to determine custody and access. It is clearly stated in Article 19 that a return \u000d\u000adecision is not a decision on the merits of any custody issue. It is this which justifies the requirement in Article \u000d\u000a12 that the return order be made \u201cforthwith\u201d, and of Article 16 that a court dealing with an abduction case is \u000d\u000anot permitted to decide on \u201cthe merits of rights of custody\u201d until it has been decided that there exists a reason \u000d\u000afor not ordering return, or the application is not lodged within a reasonable time.\u000d\u000aThe requirements to be met by an applicant for a return order are strict. He / she must establish: that the child \u000d\u000awas habitually residing in the other State; that the removal or retention of the child constituted a breach of ","Chapter 5: Children Page 93\u000d\u000acustody rights attributed by the law of that State; and that the applicant was actually exercising those rights at \u000d\u000athe time of the wrongful removal or retention.\u000d\u000aOnce the applicant has established a prima facie case under Article 3 b, there remains the possibility of the \u000d\u000aapplication being rejected under Article 13 if consent or subsequent acquiescence to the removal can be shown, \u000d\u000aor there is a grave risk that return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place \u000d\u000athe child in an intolerable situation. Also under Article 13 the objections of the child, if he/she has attained \u000d\u000asufficient age and maturity, may be a basis for refusal. Article 12 gives a discretion not to return a child if the \u000d\u000aapplication was made a year after the removal or retention and the child is now settled in his / her new \u000d\u000aenvironment. Finally, under Article 20 return may be refused if this would not be permitted by the fundamental \u000d\u000arules relating to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms of the State addressed.\u000d\u000aCo-operation\u000d\u000aAs is usual among the Hague Children\u2019s Conventions, Central Authorities in each Contracting State are given \u000d\u000aan integral role as the focus for administrative co-operation in achieving child protection. Central Authorities \u000d\u000ain each country provide assistance in locating the child and in achieving, if possible, a voluntary return of the \u000d\u000achild or an amicable resolution of the issues. They also co-operate to prevent further harm to the child by \u000d\u000ainitiating or helping to initiate proceedings for the return of the child, and by making necessary administrative \u000d\u000aarrangements to secure the child\u2019s safe return. Article 21 also gives the Central Authorities obligations to \u000d\u000apromote the peaceful enjoyment of access rights and to take steps to remove, as far as possible, obstacles to the \u000d\u000aexercise of such rights.\u000d\u000aSignificant post-Convention work has also been carried out on the 1980 Abduction Convention. A Special \u000d\u000aCommission for the Monitoring and Review of the Operation of the 1980 Abduction Convention has been set \u000d\u000aup and meets every few years to discuss developments. In addition, the Hague Conference has produced \u000d\u000aseveral Guides to Good Practice for the implementation and operation of the Convention and provides other \u000d\u000aresources such as a database of case law (INCADAT) and of statistics (INCASTAT) relating to international \u000d\u000achild abduction.\u000d\u000aProtecting children and their rights\u000d\u000aWhile pre-dating the CRC, the 1980 Hague Convention in part implements CRC Articles 11 and 35; it helps to \u000d\u000agive effect to the fundamental rights of the child, such as those expressed in CRC Articles 9.3 and 10.2 and has \u000d\u000abeen found in a number of court decisions in different parts of the world to be consistent with national \u000d\u000aConstitutions, as well as regional and international human rights instruments.\u000d\u000aThe UN Committee on the Rights of the Child recommends CRC States to become Party to the 1980 Hague \u000d\u000aConvention as a means by which CRC Article 11 may be practically implemented. The 1980 Hague \u000d\u000aConvention has contributed to resolving thousands of abduction cases and has served as a deterrent to many \u000d\u000aothers through the clarity of its message (abduction is harmful to children, who have a right to contact with \u000d\u000aboth parents) and through the simplicity of its central remedy (the return order). With currently more than 90 \u000d\u000aContracting States, the 1980 Hague Convention can be viewed as one of the most successful family law \u000d\u000ainstruments to be completed under the auspices of the Hague Conference on Private International Law.\u000d\u000aThe operation of the 1980 Hague Convention has been further strengthened by complementing provisions in \u000d\u000athe Convention of 19 October 1996 on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Cooperation in Respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children.","Chapter 5: Children Page 94\u000d\u000aThe Child Abduction Section on the website of the Hague Conference contains the latest information about \u000d\u000athe status of the 1980 Convention, and the contact details of Central Authorities.

His father, David Goldman, was waiting for \u000d\u000ahim inside. Sean cried as his Brazilian relatives and \u000d\u000afamily lawyer tried to get him through the scrum. \u000d\u000aHe carried his luggage and wore a gold shirt with \u000d\u000athe Brazilian flag and Olympic rings underneath. \u000d\u000aGoldman didn't speak as he was led from a black \u000d\u000aSUV across the street to the consulate. His maternal \u000d\u000agrandmother, Silvana Bianchi, said in tears that \u000d\u000a\"this is a very difficult moment.\"\u000d\u000aThe case neared its conclusion Wednesday \u000d\u000awhen lawyers for the boy's Brazilian stepfamily said \u000d\u000athey were giving up the fight and handing him back \u000d\u000ato his American dad. \"There comes a time when you \u000d\u000ahave to say the war is over,\" Sergio Tostes, lawyer \u000d\u000afor Sean's step father Jo\u00e3o Paulo Lins e Silva told \u000d\u000aTIME. \"We could appeal but that would only \u000d\u000aprolong the suffering. We don't want to prolong this \u000d\u000aanymore.\"\u000d\u000aTostes said he was speaking with \u000d\u000arepresentatives from the office of Brazil's Attorney \u000d\u000aGeneral to make the practical arrangements for \u000d\u000ahanding over the boy. The AG's office is the \u000d\u000aplaintiff in the case, and the legally proper authority \u000d\u000ato decide where and when Sean would be returned \u000d\u000ato his father, Tostes said. He promised the step \u000d\u000afamily would work to ensure the transition was \"as \u000d\u000asmooth as possible\" and suggested the handover \u000d\u000awould not take place until Christmas Eve at the \u000d\u000aearliest. That deadline was given added weight later \u000d\u000aon Wednesday when a federal court in Rio later said \u000d\u000athe handover must be completed at the U.S. \u000d\u000aconsulate by 9 a.m. on Thursday.\u000d\u000aThe president of Brazil's Supreme Court ruled \u000d\u000aTuesday night that Sean must be returned to his \u000d\u000aAmerican father immediately. Yet there had been \u000d\u000aconcern that the stepfamily would appeal the ruling, \u000d\u000aas it had done in response to every previous \u000d\u000aunfavorable decision. If an appeal had been made, \u000d\u000ait would have required that the case be heard by all \u000d\u000a11 judges on the Supreme Court bench \u2014 and \u000d\u000abecause the court does not return from recess until \u000d\u000aFeb. 1, that would have meant Sean spending yet \u000d\u000aanother Christmas away from his father.\u000d\u000aTostes' statement appears to have quashed \u000d\u000athat possibility, freeing Sean to return with his dad \u000d\u000ato New Jersey \u2014 where he has not lived for the past \u000d\u000afive years. According to news reports, the boy \u000d\u000abarely speaks English now. Lawyers for Goldman \u000d\u000adid not return telephone calls.\u000d\u000aSean was born in New Jersey in 2000, the \u000d\u000aonly son of David Goldman and his Brazilian wife, \u000d\u000aBruna Bianchi. However, Bruna brought the child \u000d\u000ato visit her family in Brazil in 2004 and never \u000d\u000areturned. She divorced David and married Joao \u000d\u000aPaulo Lins e Silva, a well-known Rio de Janeiro \u000d\u000alawyer. The couple kept Sean in Brazil, and David \u000d\u000aGoldman's legal efforts to regain custody were \u000d\u000arebuffed by Brazilian courts on the grounds that the \u000d\u000aboy's relationship with his mother was his primary \u000d\u000abond.\u000d\u000aBianchi then fell pregnant with her new \u000d\u000ahusband's child but died in childbirth in 2008. Her \u000d\u000ahusband refused to return Sean to his father, and has \u000d\u000abeen fighting for custody ever since. He and his \u000d\u000aBrazilian family said the child had spent so long in \u000d\u000aBrazil that it would be cruel to return him to a father \u000d\u000ahe hardly knew.\u000d\u000aA Federal appeals court in Rio de Janeiro \u000d\u000alast week ruled in favor of Goldman, and gave the ","Chapter 5: Children Page 95\u000d\u000astepfamily 48 hours to hand the boy over. But a \u000d\u000aSupreme Court judge overturned that ruling on \u000d\u000aappeal. Although the court was not obliged to take \u000d\u000aup the case again until after its return from recess, \u000d\u000aMendes, the court's president, classed the matter as \u000d\u000aurgent and decided to rule immediately.\u000d\u000aHe ruled on Tuesday night that that as a \u000d\u000asignatory to the Hague Convention on the \u000d\u000aprotection of children, Brazil was obliged to return \u000d\u000athe boy. Governments of both Brazil and the U.S. \u000d\u000aagreed and Mendes warned in his ruling that if \u000d\u000aBrazil did not hand him over it would weaken the \u000d\u000aposition of Brazilian parents when arguing cases \u000d\u000awith other governments.\u000d\u000aThe Goldman case has caused considerable \u000d\u000acontroversy in both Brazil and the U.S., with the \u000d\u000apresidents of both nations publicly proclaiming that \u000d\u000aSean should be returned to his father. Public \u000d\u000aopinion, also, has been fervent and divided. Many \u000d\u000aBrazilians believe the boy should be reunited with \u000d\u000ahis father, but others criticized David Goldman for \u000d\u000anot visiting his son after he had been taken to Brazil.","Chapter 5: Children Page 96\u000d\u000aSean Goldman, 10 years after reunion with dad, fights for other abducted kids. \u000d\u000aBy: Jerry Carino, Asbury Park Press\u000d\u000ahttps://www.app.com/story/news/local/values/2019/08/08/david-goldman-sean-goldman-international-childabduction/1941551001/\u000d\u000aAugust 8, 2019\u000d\u000aThis year marks the 10th anniversary of Sean\u2019s \u000d\u000areturn to his father, David, a high-profile reunion \u000d\u000afollowing five years of legal wrangling after he \u000d\u000awas kidnapped by his mother and sequestered with \u000d\u000aher family in Brazil. This week marks the fifth \u000d\u000aanniversary of the signing of the Sean and David \u000d\u000aGoldman Child Abduction Act, which gives the \u000d\u000aU.S. state department authority to pressure nations, \u000d\u000alike Brazil, that harbor abducted kids.\u000d\u000aTo mark the law\u2019s anniversary, Sean spoke publicly \u000d\u000afor the first time Thursday. His father was by his \u000d\u000aside as were two others instrumental in resolving his \u000d\u000acase: Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., and Red Bankbased attorney Patricia Apy, whose firm Paras Apy \u000d\u000a& Reiss hosted the news conference.\u000d\u000a\u201cI\u2019m thinking about a political science major,\" Sean \u000d\u000asaid, \"because, well, I guess you guys can guess \u000d\u000awhy.\"\u000d\u000aThe faces of an issue\u000d\u000aThe Goldmans\u2019 backstory story is welldocumented. In 2004 Sean\u2019s mother, Brazil-born \u000d\u000aBruna Bianchi, told then-husband David she was \u000d\u000ataking Sean on a two-week vacation to visit family \u000d\u000ain her native country.\u000d\u000aUpon arriving she called David, informing them \u000d\u000atheir marriage was over and that Sean would not be \u000d\u000areturning to the United States. After Bianchi died in \u000d\u000achildbirth in 2008, her family refused to give the \u000d\u000aboy to his father.\u000d\u000aBut David\u2019s relentless pursuit of custody and a \u000d\u000acombination of diplomatic and media pressure \u2014\u000d\u000athe latter led by late Asbury Park Press columnist \u000d\u000aBill Handleman, whom Smith acknowledged in his \u000d\u000aremarks Thursday \u2014 led to Sean\u2019s return home on \u000d\u000aChristmas Eve of 2009.\u000d\u000a\u201cWe talk about child abduction now and most \u000d\u000aAmericans, because of this case, understand what \u000d\u000athat means,\u201d Apy said. \u201cThey understand this is not \u000d\u000aa custody case gone bad. This is not merely a family \u000d\u000adispute or bad matrimonial case. This is an act \u000d\u000awhich has been identified as an aspect of child \u000d\u000aabuse.\u000d\u000a\u201cNow we look at child abuse completely differently. \u000d\u000aSean and David put a human face on something that \u000d\u000awas very difficult for most Americans to grasp.\u201d\u000d\u000aIt took time even for Sean to grasp it. At first, he a \u000d\u000abewildered kid who\u2019d been through an international \u000d\u000atug of war. And he'd heard negative things about his \u000d\u000adad from the family in Brazil \u2014 most notably that \u000d\u000ahis father had no interest in him \u2014 for five years.\u000d\u000a\u201cIt took me a week-and-a-half after coming home to \u000d\u000acall him \u2018Dad,\u2019\u201d Sean said. \u201cIt was hard. You\u2019re told \u000d\u000aone thing for a lot of your life, and then you see it\u2019s \u000d\u000ajust lies. As a kid, you feel betrayed.\u201d\u000d\u000aThe breakthrough, calling David \u2018Dad,\u2019 happened \u000d\u000aby accident.\u000d\u000a\u201cI did it out of panic,\u201d Sean said. \u201cIt was winter and \u000d\u000aI was falling into a river. But it felt natural. One step \u000d\u000aat a time, I just felt more and more at home.\u201d\u000d\u000aNow he\u2019s trying to help others take those steps.\u000d\u000a'Sensible thing to do'\u000d\u000aThe bad stuff Sean Goldman heard about his dad has \u000d\u000aa legal name \u2014 \u201cparental alienation\u201d \u2014 and as a \u000d\u000asurvivor, he views counseling others as a calling. He \u000d\u000arecently met with siblings who were returned home \u000d\u000aafter being abducted to Argentina, and he\u2019ll be \u000d\u000atestifying on the subject at the House of \u000d\u000aRepresentatives next month.","Chapter 5: Children Page 97\u000d\u000a\u201cTo me, (advocacy) seems like the only sensible \u000d\u000athing to do,\u201d Sean said. \u201cI\u2019ve been through it, so I \u000d\u000aunderstand what it\u2019s like. It\u2019s a very confusing time \u000d\u000afor a kid. It\u2019s like your whole world gets flipped \u000d\u000aupside down. To at least have someone they\u2019re \u000d\u000asaying, \u2018Yeah I\u2019ve been through it, too,\u2019 I can only \u000d\u000aimagine that\u2019s been helpful.\u201d\u000d\u000aIn the 10 years since Sean\u2019s return, David Goldman \u000d\u000ahas remained at the front line of the issue as well. \u000d\u000aHe regularly speaks with parents coping with \u000d\u000ainternational child abduction.\u000d\u000a\u201cI try just to let them know that they\u2019re not alone,\u201d \u000d\u000aDavid said. \u201cDon\u2019t give up hope. Look for \u000d\u000adistractions throughout your day because it\u2019s \u000d\u000apainful to go through every moment. The little \u000d\u000athings will tug at your heartstrings, just even \u000d\u000awatching TV and seeing a child on there. Things \u000d\u000alike missing Sean losing his first tooth.\u201d\u000d\u000aHe gets to tell parents something he never heard \u000d\u000aduring Sean\u2019s ordeal.\u000d\u000a\u201cWe\u2019re in your corner,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a law.\u201d\u000d\u000a'Much remains to be done'\u000d\u000aSince the enactment of the Goldman Act in 2014, \u000d\u000areported cases of children being abducted from the \u000d\u000aUnited States have fallen by nearly 20 percent. Still, \u000d\u000aSmith estimates, nearly 450 American kids become \u000d\u000avictims each year.\u000d\u000a\u201cMuch progress has been made,\u201d Smith said. \u000d\u000a\u201cHowever, much remains to be done.\u201d\u000d\u000aThe sanctions made allowable by the law \u201cneed to \u000d\u000abe robustly applied,\u201d Smith said. \u201cTo date, they \u000d\u000ahave not been either by the Obama administration \u000d\u000aor the Trump administration.\u201d\u000d\u000aTo drive home the point, Smith invited Manalapan \u000d\u000aresident Ravi Parmar to the news conference. In \u000d\u000a2012, Parmar\u2019s ex-wife took their 3-year-old son, \u000d\u000aReynash, to India, and he hasn't seen the boy since.\u000d\u000a\u201cThe experiences that David and Sean shared and \u000d\u000athat Mr. Smith has been championing, we need to \u000d\u000aspread awareness, but it\u2019s also time for the U.S. \u000d\u000agovernment to play a more robust role in securing \u000d\u000atheir return,\u201d Parmar said. \u201cI called the FBI for three \u000d\u000amonths every week before somebody actually \u000d\u000aresponded to my request.\u201d\u000d\u000aFBI officials, he said, told him, \u201cYour child is not \u000d\u000aabducted; he\u2019s with his mother.\u201d\u000d\u000aSmith said India, Japan and Brazil are three of the \u000d\u000amost recalcitrant countries when dealing with \u000d\u000ainternational child abduction, and said seven New \u000d\u000aJersey children have been removed to India in the \u000d\u000apast year alone. Apy said she hopes Gov. Phil \u000d\u000aMurphy will raise the issue during a scheduled visit \u000d\u000ato India this fall.\u000d\u000a\u201cThis is of the few crimes where the victims are held \u000d\u000aresponsible to solve the crime,\u201d Parmar said.\u000d\u000aThe reason the Goldmans are making the media \u000d\u000arounds is to remind everyone that the tools to \u000d\u000aaddress such situations are there now, provided by \u000d\u000athe law that bears their name. They just need to be \u000d\u000aapplied.\u000d\u000aDavid\u2019s been front and center saying this for years. \u000d\u000aNow Sean is old enough to join him, doubling the \u000d\u000amessage\u2019s power.\u000d\u000a\u201cThese families need help like we got,\u201d David \u000d\u000aGoldman said. \u201cWith our law and the punitive \u000d\u000ameasures we can place on these countries, hopefully \u000d\u000awe can get these cases resolved and children won\u2019t \u000d\u000asuffer.\u201d"]
